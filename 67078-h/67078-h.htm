CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
"TIGER" BUGG VERSUS "LIGHTNING" LOPEZ
</h3>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn sighed gently and put down her
cup on the tea-table.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose, Tony," she said, "that when one gets
to seventy-two, one's conscience begins to decay just
as one's body does.  I seem to like good people less
and immoral and useless ones more.  You are the
only member of the family it gives me the faintest
pleasure to see nowadays."
</p>

<p>
Sir Antony Raymond Fulk Desmoleyn Conway&mdash;Conway
Bart., more commonly known as Tony,
nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"They are rather a stuffy lot the others, aren't
they!" he answered cheerfully.  "Who's been round
to see you?"
</p>

<p>
"Only Laura and Henry as yet."  Lady Jocelyn
spoke with some thankfulness.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's enough," observed Tony.  "Ten
minutes with either of them always makes me feel
I want to do something improper."
</p>

<p>
"Allowing for age and infirmity," said Lady
Jocelyn, "they have a rather similar effect on me."
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed.  "So you have heard all about my
misdeeds?"
</p>

<p>
"I would hardly go as far as that.  They were
only here for two hours.  You may smoke you know,
Tony, if you want to."
</p>

<p>
He lighted a cigarette.  "Tell me, Aunt Fanny,"
he pleaded.  "There is no pleasure in blackening
the family name unless one hears what the family
says about it."
</p>

<p>
"The family," remarked Lady Jocelyn, "has a
good deal to say about it.  They consider that not
only are you wasting your own life in the most
deplorable manner, but that your methods of amusing
yourself are calculated to bring a certain amount
of discredit upon your more distinguished relatives.
Henry attributes it chiefly to the demoralizing effect
of wealth; Laura thinks that you were born with
naturally low tastes."
</p>

<p>
"They're both right," observed Tony placidly.
"I am what Guy calls 'a menace to my order.'  That's
a jolly way for one's secretary to talk to one,
isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the only way dear Guy can talk, and after
all I daresay he is telling the truth."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure he is," said Tony.  "Guy is quite
incapable of telling anything else."  He paused.
"Was Henry referring to any recent atrocity?"
</p>

<p>
"I think your choice of friends is what distresses
him chiefly.  He said that your more intimate
acquaintances appear to consist of prize-fighters and
chauffeurs."
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed good-humouredly.  "I do a bit of
motor racing, you know.  I suppose that's what
he meant by chauffeurs.  As for prize-fighters&mdash;well,
somebody must have been telling him about
Bugg."
</p>

<p>
"About what?" inquired Lady Jocelyn mildly.
</p>

<p>
"Bugg," repeated Tony.  "'Tiger' Bugg.  He's a
youthful protégé of mine&mdash;a boxer.  In about three
years, when he's grown a bit, he'll be champion of
England."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn's good-humoured face wrinkled up
into a whimsical smile.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Tony," she said.  "Your conversation is
always so stimulating.  Tell me some more about
Mr. Tiger Bugg.  What a name!  It sounds like
some kind of American butterfly."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he spells it with two g's," said Tony.  "It's
a very good name in the East End of London.  There
have been Buggs in Whitechapel for generations."
</p>

<p>
"So I have always understood," replied Lady
Jocelyn.  "How did you come across this particular
branch of the family?"
</p>

<p>
"It was at a boxing club off the Stepney High
Street.  It's a blackguard sort of place run by a Jew
named Isaacs.  He gets in the East End street boys,
and they fight each other for nothing in the hope that
some boxing promoter will see them and give them a
chance.  Well, one night when I was there they put
up this boy Bugg against a fellow who was big
enough to eat him&mdash;a chap who knew something
about the game, too.  Bugg was hammered nearly
silly in the first round, but he came up for the second
and popped in a left hook bang on the point that put
the big chap to sleep for almost ten minutes.  It was
one of the prettiest things I've ever seen."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds delightful," said Lady Jocelyn.  "Go
on, Tony."
</p>

<p>
"I was so pleased with his pluck," pursued the
baronet tranquilly, "that I sent for him after the
show and took him out to have some supper.  I
thought he was precious hungry from the way he
wolfed his food, and when I asked him I found he'd
had nothing to eat all day except a bit of dry bread
for breakfast.  In addition to that he had tramped
about ten miles looking for a job.  Hardly what
one would call a good preparation for fighting a
fellow twice your size."
</p>

<p>
"It seems a most deserving case," remarked Lady
Jocelyn sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I thought," said Tony.  "I had him
up to Hampstead the next day and I gave him a good
try out with the gloves.  I saw at once that I'd got
hold of something quite out of the common.  He
didn't know much about the science of the game, but
he was just a born boxer&mdash;one of those boys who take
to fighting as naturally as they do to breathing.  He
seemed a decent lad too in his way&mdash;a bit rough, of
course, but then you couldn't expect anything else.
Anyhow the end of it was I took him on, and he has
been with me ever since."
</p>

<p>
"How nice!" said Lady Jocelyn.  "And in
what capacity does he figure in the household
returns?"
</p>

<p>
Tony indulged in a smile.  "I always call him my
assistant secretary," he said, "just to fetch old Guy.
As a matter of fact Bugg is a most useful chap.
There's hardly anything he can't do.  When he
isn't training for a fight, we use him as a sort of
maid-of-all-work."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he still fights then?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather," said Tony.  "He has never been
beaten yet.  Backing Bugg is my only source of
income apart from the estate.  I made twelve
hundred pounds out of him last year."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!" exclaimed Lady Jocelyn.  "I had no
idea you had a regular profession like that, Tony.
What sort of people does he fight with?"
</p>

<p>
"We are open to meet any one in the world up to
ten stone seven.  In fact there are only about four
who really matter that he hasn't met.  There will be
one less after to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"What happens to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Bugg is going to fight 'Lightning Lopez' at the
Cosmopolitan."
</p>

<p>
"What beautiful names all these people seem to
have," said Lady Jocelyn.  "Who is 'Lightning
Lopez'?"
</p>

<p>
"He calls himself the champion welter-weight of
Europe," replied Tony a little contemptuously.
"He's half an American and half a Livadian.  That's
why Pedro has taken him up."
</p>

<p>
"Pedro?" repeated Lady Jocelyn.  "Do you mean
King Pedro?"
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "Yes, Lopez is being backed by
royalty or rather ex-royalty.  We hope to have
five hundred of the best out of His Majesty by
to-morrow night."
</p>

<p>
"Are you a friend of Pedro's?" asked Lady
Jocelyn.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hardly that," said Tony.  "He belongs to
the Cosmo, you know, and I often meet him at
races and first nights."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn paused for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"I remember him very well as a little boy at
Portriga before the revolution," she said.  "What
has he grown up like?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," observed Tony, thoughtfully brushing
some cigarette ash from his sleeve, "he's short and
fat and dark and rather spotty, and he drinks too
much."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn nodded.  "Ah!" she said, "just like
his poor father.  Has he inherited the family
weakness for female society?"
</p>

<p>
"He's a bit of a rip," said Tony.  "Or rather he
was.  Molly Monk of the Gaiety has got hold of
him now, and I think she keeps him pretty straight.
She's not the sort to stand any nonsense, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"I will take your word for it, Tony," said Lady
Jocelyn gravely.
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed.  "Well, you can, Aunt Fanny," he
returned.  "I've known Molly since she was a little
flapper.  She is the granddaughter of old Monk who
used to look after the lodge at Holbeck."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn raised her eyebrows.  "Dear me!"
she exclaimed.  "Is that so, Tony!  Why I remember
the old man perfectly.  She must be a clever
girl to have got on like she has.  What a pity she
couldn't be content with her profession."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Molly's all right," said Tony carelessly.
"She's straight enough as girls of that sort go.
You can be quite sure she's really fond of Pedro or
she wouldn't have anything to do with him."
</p>

<p>
"He didn't sound exactly lovable from your
description of him," remarked Lady Jocelyn.
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps I didn't do him justice.  He isn't
such a bad fellow in his way, you know.  He drinks
too much and he's stupid and spoilt, but he's quite
good-natured and amiable with it.  I have no doubt
Molly can twist him round her finger; and I suppose
there's a certain attraction in having a king trotting
around after you&mdash;even if he is out of a job.  No
doubt it annoys the other girls."
</p>

<p>
"As a bachelor, my dear boy," said Lady Jocelyn,
"you have no right to be so well acquainted with
feminine weaknesses."  She paused.  "You know
you really ought to get married, Tony," she added,
"if only to circulate your income."
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed.  "You have hit on my one strong
point as a capitalist," he said.  "You ask Guy,
Aunt Fanny!"
</p>

<p>
"But you can't spend forty thousand a year by
yourself&mdash;surely?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I get a little help now and then.  I don't
know that I really want it though.  It's wonderful
what one can do with practice and a steam yacht."
</p>

<p>
"It's not nearly as wonderful as what you could
do with a wife," said Lady Jocelyn.  "Anyhow you
ought to get married if only to please me.  I shall
soon be too old for travelling about, and then I shall
want some really naughty children to give me an
interest in life.  I shall never be interested in
Henry's twins: they are such dreadful little prigs."
</p>

<p>
Tony got up from his chair and taking the old
lady's slender, much beringed hand raised it to his
lips.
</p>

<p>
"If you feel like that, Aunt Fanny," he said, "I
shall certainly have to think about it.  You won't
mind who she is, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"I only make two stipulations," said Lady Jocelyn.
"She mustn't be a German and she mustn't
wear squeaky boots."
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed.  "All right, Aunt Fanny," he
said.  "I can promise you that safely."
</p>

<p>
He walked to the window and glanced down into
Chester Square where a huge venomous-looking,
two-seated Peugot was filling up the roadway.
</p>

<p>
"I must toddle away now," he observed.  "I
want to run up to the Club, and see that everything's
all right for to-morrow night, and then I must get
back home and change.  I have promised to go to
this fancy dress dance at the Albert Hall, and it will
take me a long time to look like Charles the
Second."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn leaned forward and rang the bell.
"Come and see me again some day, Tony," she said,
"when you have nothing better to do.  I shall be
home till the end of July, at all events."
</p>

<p>
Tony bent down and kissed her affectionately.
"I shall often be dropping in if I may," he said.  "I
am always in scrapes you know, Aunt Fanny, and
you are about the only person I can look to for a little
sympathy and encouragement."
</p>

<p>
"If my moral support is of any use, Tony," she
said, "you can count on it to the utmost."
</p>

<p>
Outside the house a small crowd of loafers and
errand boys had gathered round the car, which with
its enormous strapped bonnet and disk wheels looked
singularly out of place in this trim, respectable
neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
"Wotyer call that, guv'nor?" inquired one of
them.  "A cycle car?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the new Baby Peugot," replied Tony gravely.
</p>

<p>
He started up the engine, and climbing into the
seat, disappeared round the corner, followed by the
admiring glances of his audience.
</p>

<p>
The Cosmopolitan Club, the headquarters of
British pugilism, is situated in Covent Garden.  It is
regarded by some excellent people as a plague spot
that will eventually be wiped away by the rising flood
of a more humanized civilization, but this opinion
can hardly be said to represent the views of the porter
and carmen who frequent the vicinity.  To them the
Club represents all that is best and brightest in
English civilization, and amongst its numerous and
oddly assorted members nobody could claim to be
better known or more popular than Tony.
</p>

<p>
As the big car picked its way over the cobbles,
twisting neatly in and out between unattended carts
and piles of empty baskets, a good number of the
men who were lounging about greeted the owner with
a friendly salute.  When he reached the Club and
pulled up, several of them stepped forward eagerly
to open the door.
</p>

<p>
"'Ow abaht ter-morrer, sir," inquired one huge,
hoarse-voiced carter.  "Sife to shove a bit on
Tiger?"
</p>

<p>
"You can shove your horse and cart on him," said
Tony, "and if it doesn't come off I'll buy you
another."
</p>

<p>
He jumped out and crossed the pavement, followed
by an approving murmur from everyone who had
heard his offer.
</p>

<p>
The carter spat decisively into the gutter.  "E's
a ruddy nobleman, 'e is," he observed, looking round
the group with a bloodshot eye.  "'Oo says 'e
ain't?"
</p>

<p>
No one ventured on such a rash assertion; indeed,
putting aside the carter's discouraging air, everyone
present considered Tony's offer to be the very acme
of aristocratic behaviour.
</p>

<p>
The creator of this favourable impression pushed
open the swinging door of the Club and, accepting
a couple of letters from the hotel porter, walked
through into the comfortably furnished bar lounge at
the back.  Its two inhabitants, who were each in the
act of consuming a cocktail, glanced round at his
entrance.  One was "Doggy" Donaldson, the manager,
a burly, genial-looking, bullet-headed individual
with close-cropped grey hair, and a permanently
unlit cigar jutting up rakishly out of the corner of
his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Tony," he exclaimed.  "You're just in
time to join us.  You know the Marquis da Freitas,
of course?"
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded easily, and Donaldson's companion,
a stout, dark-complexioned, well-dressed man of
about fifty with a certain air of distinction about
him, returned the greeting with a courteous wave
of his hand.
</p>

<p>
"We meet as enemies, Sir Antony," he remarked
smilingly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I just dropped in for a second to see that
everything was all right about to-morrow," said Tony.
"Our boy is in fine form: never been fitter.  I hope
you have been equally lucky?"
</p>

<p>
The Marquis indulged in the faintest possible shrug
of his broad shoulders.  "I believe so," he said.  "I
am not a great authority on these matters myself, but
they amuse His Majesty."
</p>

<p>
"Everything's O.K.," observed the manager in a
satisfied voice.  "We sold the last seat this morning,
and there have been several applications since.  It's
going to be the best night of the season.  You will
see your boy turns up in good time, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
Tony helped himself to the cocktail, which the
barman, without asking any superfluous questions,
had been quietly preparing for him.
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," he said, drinking it off.  "What's
the betting, Doggy?"
</p>

<p>
"Martin-Smith told me this morning he'd got a
level hundred on Lopez."
</p>

<p>
Tony put down the empty glass.  "Ah well," he
said, "he can afford to lose it."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"You seem confident, Sir Antony," remarked the
Marquis in his suave voice.  "Perhaps you would
like to back your opinion a little further.  I don't
know much about this sort of thing, as I said just
now, but I am prepared to support our man if only
from patriotic motives."
</p>

<p>
"Anything you care to suggest, Marquis," said
Tony indifferently.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we say a couple of hundred, then?"
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded, and booked the bet on his shirt
cuff.
</p>

<p>
"I must be off now," he said.  "I suppose you and
the King will be at the Albert Hall to-night?"
</p>

<p>
The Marquis shook his head.  "I do not think His
Majesty intends to be present.  As for me&mdash;" he
again shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"I grow old for such
frivolities."
</p>

<p>
"Well, till to-morrow then," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
He passed out again through the hall, and jumping
into the car steered his way slowly round the corner
into Long Acre, where he branched off in the direction
of Piccadilly.  He was just passing Garnett's, the
celebrated theatrical costumier, when the door of
that eminent establishment swung open, and a very
pretty and smartly dressed girl stepped out on to
the pavement.  Directly Tony saw her he checked
the car and turned it gently in towards the gutter.
</p>

<p>
She came up to him with a most attractive smile.
</p>

<p>
"But how convenient, Tony," she exclaimed.
"You will be able to drive me home.  I was just
going to waste my money on a taxi."
</p>

<p>
He leaned across and opened the door.  "You can
give me the bob instead, Molly," he said.  "Jump
in."
</p>

<p>
She stepped up alongside of him, and with a harsh
croak the big car glided forward again into the
thronging bustle of Leicester Square.
</p>

<p>
"Funny picking you up like this," he said.  "I've
just been talking about you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm always being talked about," replied Molly
serenely.  "I hope you weren't as nasty as most
people."
</p>

<p>
"I was saying that you were the only girl in
London with that particular shade of red hair."  Tony
brought out this shameless untruth with the
utmost coolness.
</p>

<p>
"It is rather nice, isn't it?" said Molly.  "All
the girls think I touch it up.  As a matter of fact
it's one of the few parts of me I don't."  She paused.
"What were you really saying about me, Tony?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, quite nice things," he replied.  "Can you
fancy me saying anything else?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she said.  "I'll admit you're an amiable
beast as men go.  But why haven't you been to see
me lately?"
</p>

<p>
Grasping his opportunity Tony darted across the
bows of an onrushing motor-bus, and gained the
comparative shelter of Regent Street.
</p>

<p>
"If it is a fact," he observed, "I can only attribute
it to idiocy."
</p>

<p>
"You know it's a fact," said Molly, "and it's
hurt me, Tony.  I wouldn't mind being chucked by
any one else.  But somehow you're different.  I have
always looked on you as a pal."
</p>

<p>
Tony slipped his left hand off the wheel for a
second and lightly squeezed hers.
</p>

<p>
"So I am, Molly," he said.  "Why on earth
should I have changed?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought you might be sick with me about&mdash;well,
about Peter."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord, no," said Tony.  "I never criticize
my friends' hobbies.  If I haven't routed you out
lately, it's only because I've been really busy."
</p>

<p>
Her face brightened.  "You're a nice old thing,
Tony," she said.  "Come and lunch with me to-morrow
if you're not booked up.  Just us two.  I
really do want to have a talk with you, badly."
</p>

<p>
"Right-o," said Tony.  "You'll be able to give
me the latest stable information about Lopez.  It's
the fight to-morrow night, you know."
</p>

<p>
Molly nodded.  "Peter thinks he's going to win
all right," she said.  "He's cocksure about it."
</p>

<p>
"I gathered that," said Tony.  "I ran into da
Freitas at the Club just now and he bet me a level
two hundred we were in for a whipping.  I shouldn't
think he was a gentleman who chucked away his
money out of patriotic sentiment."
</p>

<p>
Molly made as near an approach to an ugly face as
nature would allow.
</p>

<p>
"You don't like him?" inquired Tony artlessly.
</p>

<p>
"He's a pig," said Molly, and then after a short
pause she added with some reluctance, "but he's a
clever pig."
</p>

<p>
"That," observed Tony, "only aggravates the
offence."
</p>

<p>
He pulled up at Basil Mansions, a big block of
luxurious flats just opposite the Langham Hotel, and
a magnificently gilded porter hastened forward to
open the door of the car.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you about him to-morrow," said Molly.
"Don't be later than half-past one.  I'm always
starving by then, and I shan't wait for you."
</p>

<p>
"I am always punctual for meals," said Tony.
"It's the only virtue that's rewarded on the spot."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
THE MORALS OF MOLLY
</h3>

<p>
It was exactly eleven o'clock when Tony woke up.
He looked at his watch, yawned, stretched himself,
ran his fingers through his hair, and then reaching out
his hand pressed the electric bell beside his bed.
After a short pause it was answered by a middle-aged,
clean-shaven man, with a face like a tired
sphinx, who entered the room carrying a cup of tea
upon a tray.  Tony sat up and blinked at him.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Spalding," he observed.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Sir Antony," returned the man;
"I trust that you slept well, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, thank you," replied Tony.  "What
time did I get home?"
</p>

<p>
"I fancy it was a little after four, sir."
</p>

<p>
Tony took a long drink out of the tea-cup, and
then put it down again.  "I am curiously thirsty
this morning, Spalding," he said.  "Was I quite
sober when I came back?"
</p>

<p>
The man hesitated.  "I should describe you as
being so, sir," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Spalding," said Tony gratefully.
</p>

<p>
Crossing the room the valet drew up the blinds,
and admitted a cheerful stream of sunshine.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Oliver left a message, sir, to say that he
would not be back until the afternoon.  He has
gone out on business and is lunching with
Mr. Henry Conway."
</p>

<p>
"Where's Bugg?" inquired Tony.
</p>

<p>
"At the present moment, sir, I believe he is in the
gymnasium.  He informed me that he was about to
loosen his muscles with a little shadow boxing."
</p>

<p>
"Is he all right?"
</p>

<p>
"He appears to be in the most robust health, sir."
</p>

<p>
A look of relief passed across Tony's face.  "You
have taken a weight off my mind, Spalding," he said.
"I dreamed that he had broken his neck."
</p>

<p>
The valet shook his head reassuringly.
</p>

<p>
"I observed no sign of it, sir, when I passed him in
the hall."
</p>

<p>
"In that case," said Tony, "I think I shall get up.
You can fill the bath, Spalding, and you can tell the
cook I shan't want any breakfast."
</p>

<p>
The impassive servant bowed and withdrew from
the room, and after finishing his tea, Tony got
luxuriously out of bed, and proceeded to drape
himself in a blue silk dressing-gown with gold dragons
embroidered round the hem.  It was a handsome
garment originally intended for the President of
China, but that gentleman had unexpectedly rejected
it on the ground that it was too ornate for the elected
head of a democratic community.  At least that was
how the Bond Street shopman who had sold it to
Tony had accounted for its excessive price.
</p>

<p>
Lighting a cigarette, Tony sauntered across to the
bathroom, where a shave, a cold tub, and a few
minutes of Muller's exercises were sufficient to
remove the slight trace of lassitude induced by his
impersonation of Charles the Second.  Then, still
clad in his dressing-gown, he strolled down the main
staircase, and opening the front door passed out into
the garden.
</p>

<p>
The house was one of those two or three jolly
old-fashioned survivals which still stand in their own
grounds in the neighbourhood of Jack Straw's Castle.
Tony had bought up the freehold several years
previously, the quaint old Georgian residence in its
delightful surroundings appealing to him far more
than his own gloomy family mansion in Belgrave
Square.  As he himself was fond of explaining, it
gave one all the charm of living in the country
without any of its temptations to virtue.
</p>

<p>
A few yards' walk along a gravel path, hedged in
on each side by thick laurel bushes, brought him to
the gymnasium.  The door was slightly open, and
from the quick patter and shuffle of footsteps inside,
it sounded as if a number of ballet girls were
practising a novel and rather complicated form of step
dance.
</p>

<p>
The spectacle that actually met Tony's eyes when
he entered, however, was of a less seductive nature.
Clad only in a pair of flannel trousers, a young man
was spinning and darting about the room in the most
extraordinary fashion, indulging at the same time in
lightning-like movements with his head and arms.
To the uninitiated observer he would have appeared
to be either qualifying for a lunatic asylum or else
attempting the difficult feat of catching flies on the
wing.  As a matter of fact either assumption would
have been equally inaccurate.  He was engaged in
what is known amongst pugilists as "shadow boxing"
which consists of conducting an animated contest
with a vicious but imaginary opponent.
</p>

<p>
On seeing Tony the young man in question came
to an abrupt halt in the middle of the room, and
raised his forefinger to his close-cropped forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Mornin', Sir Ant'ny," he observed.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding his exertions he spoke without
the least trace of breathlessness, and there was
no sign of perspiration upon his clean white skin.
He looked what he was&mdash;a splendidly built lad of
about nineteen, trained to the last pitch of physical
fitness.
</p>

<p>
Tony glanced him over with an approving eye.
"Good-morning, Bugg," he answered.  "I am glad
to see you looking so well.  I dreamed you had
broken your neck."
</p>

<p>
The lad grinned cheerfully.  "Not me, sir.  Never
felt better in me life.  Must 'a bin the other bloke."
</p>

<p>
"I hope not," said Tony anxiously.  "I backed
you for another two-fifty yesterday, and I can't very
well claim the money unless the fight comes off.  By
the way, a hundred of that goes on to the purse if you
do the trick all right."
</p>

<p>
The young prize-fighter looked a trifle embarrassed.
"There ain't no call for that, sir&mdash;thankin' ye kindly
all the saime, sir.  I'd knock out 'alf a dozen blokes
like Lopez for a purse o' three 'undred."
</p>

<p>
"Your unmercenary nature is one of your chief
charms, Bugg," said Tony.  "All the same you
mustn't carry it to extremes.  How much money
have you got in the bank now?"
</p>

<p>
Bugg scratched his ear.  "The last time I goes in,
sir, the old geezer with the whiskers says somethin'
abaht a matter of eleven 'undred quid."
</p>

<p>
"Well, by to-morrow you ought to have fifteen
hundred.  In other words, Bugg, you will be a
capitalist&mdash;one of the idle rich.  That money,
properly invested, will bring you in thirty shillings a
week.  If you want to set up as an independent
gentleman now's the time to begin."
</p>

<p>
A sudden look of surprised dismay spread itself
across Bugg's square-jawed face.
</p>

<p>
"Meanin' I got the chuck, sir?" he inquired
dully.
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed.  "Of course not," he said.  "Don't
be an ass, Bugg.  I was only pointing out to you that
if you like to set up on your own you can afford to do
it.  I'll go on backing you as long as you want me to,
but you needn't feel bound to stop on here if you'd
rather clear out.  It's not much of a job for a budding
champion of England with fifteen hundred pounds in
the bank."
</p>

<p>
Bugg gave an audible sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you was 'andin' me the bird, sir," he
observed.  "Give me a proper turn it did, jest for
the minit."
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't want to go?"
</p>

<p>
Bugg laughed, almost contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"Where'd I go to, sir?" he demanded.  "'Ow long
would that fifteen 'undred last if I was knockin'
arahnd on me own with every flash cove in London
'avin' a cut at it?  'Sides, that, sir, I don't want
nothin' different.  I wouldn't change the job I got,
not to be King of England.  If it weren't for you I'd
be 'awkin' welks now, or fightin' in a booth, an'
Tiger Bugg ain't the sort to forget a thing like that.
Wen you don't want me no more, sir, jest you tip
me the orfice straight and proper and I'll 'op it,
but so long as there's any bloomin' thing I can do
for you, sir, well, 'ere I am and 'ere I means to
stop."
</p>

<p>
It was the longest speech that Tiger Bugg had
ever indulged in, and certainly the most eloquent.
Tony, who was genuinely touched by the obvious
sincerity with which it was uttered, stepped forward
and patted the lad on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, Tiger," he said.  "There will
always be a job for you here if it's only to annoy my
relations."  He paused and lighted himself another
cigarette.  "Give us a bit of your best to-night," he
added.  "I should like to make Da Freitas look silly,
and if you win easily, Donaldson has practically
promised me a match for the Lonsdale Belt."
</p>

<p>
Bugg's eyes gleamed, and his hands automatically
clenched themselves.
</p>

<p>
"I'll slip one over the fust chance I get, sir," he
observed earnestly.  "I don't think I'll 'ave to wait
long either."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded, and gathering up his dressing-gown,
turned towards the door.
</p>

<p>
"Well, be ready by eight o'clock," he said, "and
we'll go down together in the car."
</p>

<p>
Leaving the gymnasium he strolled on up the path
till it curved round the corner and opened out into
an asphalt yard, where a man in blue overalls was
attending to the toilet of the big Peugot.  He was
a tall, red-haired individual with an expression of
incurable melancholy on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Jennings," said Tony.  "It's
a nice morning, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
The chauffeur cast a resentful glance at the
unclouded blue overhead.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right at present, sir," he admitted
grudgingly, "but these here extra fine mornings have a
way of turning off sudden."
</p>

<p>
Tony sauntered up to the car, and lifting the
bonnet looked down into the gleaming network of
copper and brass which bore eloquent testimony to
the care and energy expended on it.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think she was pulling quite at her best
yesterday," he said.  "You might have a run
through and tune her up a bit, when you've got
time."
</p>

<p>
The chauffeur nodded.  "Once these here big
racin' engines begin to give trouble, sir," he remarked
with a sort of gloomy relish, "they ain't never the
same again&mdash;not in a manner o' speaking.  Least,
that's how it seems to me."
</p>

<p>
"That's how it would seem to you, Jennings,"
said Tony kindly.  "Is the Suiza all right?"
</p>

<p>
"She'll run, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, have her ready about one o'clock, and I
shall want you and the Rolls-Royce at eight to-night,
to take us down to the Club."  He paused.  "I
suppose you have backed Bugg?" he added.
</p>

<p>
Jennings shook his head.  "Not me, sir.  I think
he's flying too high, sir.  From all they tell me this
here Lopez is a terror.  I'll be sorry to see Bugg
knocked out, but there it is; it comes to all of 'em in
time."
</p>

<p>
"I like talking to you after breakfast, Jennings,"
said Tony.  "You cheer one up for the entire day."
</p>

<p>
Jennings received the compliment with an utterly
unmoved expression.  "I don't take much stock in
bein' cheerful meself, sir," he observed, "not unless
there's something to be cheerful about."
</p>

<p>
He stepped forward and resumed his work on the
car, and after watching him for a moment or two with
a pleasant languid interest Tony turned round and
sauntered back to the house.
</p>

<p>
He finished his toilet in a leisurely fashion, and
then spent an agreeable half-hour over the <i>Sportsman</i>,
which was the only morning paper that he took
in.  Current affairs of a more general nature did not
interest him much, though in times of national or
political crisis it was his habit to borrow the <i>Daily
Mail</i> from Spalding.
</p>

<p>
Soon after one, Jennings brought the Suiza round
to the front door, and a quarter of an hour later Tony
turned in through the gateway of Basil Mansions and
drew up alongside the rockery and fountain with
which a romantic landlord had enriched the centre
of the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the car there, he strolled across to Molly's
flat and rang the bell.  It was answered almost at
once by a neatly dressed French maid, who
conducted him into a bright and daintily furnished
room where Molly was sitting at the piano practising
a new song.  She jumped up gaily directly she saw
him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how nice of you, Tony," she exclaimed.
"You are ten minutes early and I'm fearfully hungry.
Lunch as soon as it's ready, Claudine."
</p>

<p>
She gave Tony her hand which he raised gallantly
to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"You are looking very beautiful this morning,
Molly," he said.  "You remind me of one of those
things that come out of ponds."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" asked Molly.  "Frogs?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Tony, "not frogs.  Those sort of jolly
wet girls with nothing on; what do you call
them&mdash;naiads, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Molly burst into a ripple of laughter.  "I don't
think that's much of a compliment to my frock,
Tony," she said.  "It was specially designed for me
by Jay's too!  Don't you like it?"
</p>

<p>
Tony stepped back and inspected her critically.
</p>

<p>
"It's wonderful," he said.  "I should imagine
Mr. Jay was now prostrate with nervous exhaustion."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," replied Molly comfortingly, "he'll
have heaps of time to recover before he's paid."
</p>

<p>
The clear note of a silver gong sounded from the
passage and she thrust her arm through Tony's.
</p>

<p>
"Come along," she said, "there are roast quails
and it would be awful if they got cold, wouldn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Tony gave a slight shudder.  "There are some
tragedies," he said, "that one hardly likes to think
about."
</p>

<p>
All through lunch, which was daintily served in
Molly's pretty, sunny little dining-room, they
chatted away in the easy cheerful fashion of two
people who have no illusions about each other and
are yet the firmest of friends.  The lunch itself was
excellent, and Claudine waited on them with a graceful
skill that lent an additional harmony to its
progress.
</p>

<p>
"I think I am in love with your new maid,"
observed Tony thoughtfully, when she at length left
them to their coffee and cigarettes.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you approve of her," said Molly, "but
if you haven't seen her before it only shows how
disgustingly you must have treated me.  She has been
here since Christmas."
</p>

<p>
"I like her face," pursued Tony.  "It's so pure.
She looks as if she had been turned out of a convent
for being too good."
</p>

<p>
"She isn't good," said Molly.  "Don't you think it."
</p>

<p>
"That only makes her all the more wonderful,"
said Tony.  "To look good and to be wicked is the
ideal combination.  You get the benefits of both
without any of their drawbacks."
</p>

<p>
"In that case," observed Molly, "I must be
dead out of luck.  With my red hair and red lips I
look desperately wicked, while as a matter of fact
I'm quite uninterestingly good&mdash;by instinct."  She
paused.  "I want to talk to you about my morals,
Tony.  That has been one of the chief reasons why
I asked you to lunch."
</p>

<p>
Tony poured out a glass of liqueur brandy.  "The
morals of Molly," he remarked contentedly.  "I
can't imagine a more perfect subject for an
after-lunch discussion."
</p>

<p>
Molly lit herself a cigarette and passed him across
the little silver box.  "It's not so much a discussion
as an explanation," she said.  "I want to explain
Peter."  She sat back in her chair.  "You see,
Tony, you're the only person in the world whose
opinion I care a hang for.  If it hadn't been for you
I don't know what would have happened to me
after I ran away from home.  You helped me to get
on the stage, and I don't want you to think I've
turned out an absolute rotter.  Oh, I know people
have always said horrid things about me, but then
they do that about any girl in musical comedy.  I
believe I'm supposed to have lived with a Rajah and
had a black baby, and Lord knows what else, but as
a matter of fact it's all lies and invention.  People
talk like that just to appear more in the swim than
somebody else.  Of course I don't mean to say I
haven't had lots of kind offers of that sort, but until
Peter came along I'd said 'no' to all of them."
</p>

<p>
"What made you pitch on Peter?" asked Tony.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Molly frankly.  "I think I
was sorry for him to start with.  He's so stupid you
know&mdash;any one can take him in, and that little cat
Marie d'Estelle was getting thousands out of him
and carrying on all the time with half a dozen other
men.  So I thought I'd just take him away if only to
teach her common decency."
</p>

<p>
"If rumour is correct," observed Tony, "the
lesson was not entirely successful."
</p>

<p>
Molly laughed.  "Well, that was how the thing
started anyway," she said.  "Peter got awfully
keen on me, and after I had seen a little bit of him
and snubbed him rather badly once or twice for being
too affectionate, I really began to get quite fond of
him.  You see if he wasn't a king he'd be a jolly good
sort.  There's nothing really the matter with him
except that he's been horribly spoilt.  He isn't a bit
vicious naturally; he only thought he was until he
met me.  He is weak and stupid, of course, but then
I like a man not to be too clever if I am going to have
much to do with him.  Stupid men stick to you, and
you can make them do just what you want.  You
know Peter consults me about practically everything."
</p>

<p>
"And what does Da Freitas think of the situation?"
asked Tony mildly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Da Freitas!"  Molly's expression was an
answer in itself.  "He hates me, Tony; he can't
stand any one having an influence over Peter except
himself.  He didn't mind d'Estelle and people like
that, in spite of the money they cost, but he would
give anything to get rid of me.  He likes Peter to
be weak and dissipated and not to bother about
things, because then he has all the power in his own
hands."
</p>

<p>
"But how is all this going to end, Molly?" asked
Tony.  "Suppose there's another revolution in Livadia,
and Peter, as you call him, has to go back to be
King.  It's quite on the cards according to what one
hears."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know," said Molly, shrugging her shoulders,
"but what's the good of worrying?  If they
knew Peter as well as I do they wouldn't be so stupid.
He'd be no earthly use as a king, by himself, and
he'd look too absolutely silly for words with a crown
on his head.  As far as his own private tastes go,
he's a lot happier at Richmond.  He quite sees it
too, you know, when I point it out to him, but he
says he wouldn't be able to help himself if there
really was a revolution."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Tony.  "I imagine Da Freitas would
see to that.  It will be a precious cold day when he
gets left.  He hasn't schemed and plotted and kept
in with Pedro all this time in order to let the chance
slip when it comes along.  If he isn't back there one
day in his old job of Prime Minister, it won't be the
fault of the Marquis Fernando."
</p>

<p>
Molly looked pensively into the fire.  "He only
makes one mistake," she said.  "He's a little too apt
to think other people are more stupid than they are.
I suppose it comes from associating so much with
poor old Peter."

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
TWO YELLOW-FACED FOREIGNERS
</h3>

<p>
Very carefully Tony sprinkled a little Bengal
pepper over the perfectly grilled sole which Spalding
had set down in front of him.  Then he returned
the bottle to the cruet-stand and looked across the
table at his cousin.
</p>

<p>
"You really ought to come to-night, Guy," he
said.  "It will be a beautiful fight while it lasts."
</p>

<p>
Guy Oliver shook his head.  He was a tall, rather
gaunt young man with a pleasant but too serious
expression.  "My dear Tony," he replied, "my
tastes may be peculiar, but as I have told you before,
it really gives me no pleasure to watch two lads
striking each other violently about the face and
body."
</p>

<p>
"You were always hard to please," complained
Tony sadly.  "Fighting is one of the few natural
and healthy occupations left to humanity."
</p>

<p>
Guy adjusted his glasses.  "I am not criticizing
fighting in its proper place," he said.  "I think
there are times when it may be necessary and even
enjoyable.  All I do object to is regarding it as a
pastime.  There are some things in life that we
are not meant to make a popular spectacle out of.
What would you say if someone suggested paying
people to make love to each other on public platforms?"
</p>

<p>
"I should say it would be most exciting," said
Tony.  "Especially the heavy-weight championship."  He
poured himself out half a glass of sherry
and held it up to the light.  "Talking of
heavy-weights," he added, "how did you find our dear
Cousin Henry?"
</p>

<p>
"Henry was very well," said Guy.  "He is coming
to see you."
</p>

<p>
Tony put down his glass and surveyed his cousin
reproachfully.  "And you call yourself a secretary
and a friend?" he remarked.
</p>

<p>
"I think it is very good for you to entertain Cousin
Henry occasionally," returned Guy.  "He is an
excellent antidote to the Cosmopolitan Club and
Brooklands."  He paused.  "Besides, he has a
suggestion to make with which I am thoroughly in
sympathy."
</p>

<p>
A depressed expression flitted across Tony's face.
"I am sure it has something to do with my duty," he
said.
</p>

<p>
Guy nodded.  "I wish you would try and look on
it in that light.  Henry has put himself to a lot of
trouble about it, and he will be very hurt if you don't
take it seriously."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Guy!" said Tony.  "A proposal of
Henry's with which you are in sympathy couldn't
possibly be taken any other way.  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"He has set his heart on your going into Parliament
as you know.  Well, he told me that last week he
had spoken about you to the Chief Whip, and that
they are arranging for you to stand as Government
candidate for Balham North at the next general
election."
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause.
</p>

<p>
"For where?" inquired Tony faintly.
</p>

<p>
"For Balham North.  It's a large constituency in
South London close to Upper Tooting."
</p>

<p>
"It would be," said Tony.  "And may I ask
what I have done to deserve this horrible fate?"
</p>

<p>
"That's just it," said Guy.  "You haven't done
anything.  Henry feels&mdash;indeed we all feel that as
head of the family it is quite time you made a start."
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand," said Tony with some
dignity.  "I am sowing my wild oats.  It is what
every wealthy young baronet is expected to do."
</p>

<p>
"Leaving out the war," retorted Guy, "you have
been sowing them for exactly six years and nine
months."
</p>

<p>
Tony smiled contentedly.  "I always think,"
he observed, "that if a thing is worth doing at all, it
is worth doing well."
</p>

<p>
There was another pause, while Guy, crumbling a
bit of bread between his fingers, regarded his cousin
with a thoughtful scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
"As far as I can see, Tony," he said, "there is
only one thing that's the least likely to do you any
good.  You want a complete change in your
life&mdash;something that will wake you up to a sense of
duty and responsibility.  I think you ought to get
married."
</p>

<p>
Tony, who was helping himself to a glass of champagne,
paused abruptly in the middle of that engaging
occupation.
</p>

<p>
"How remarkable!" he exclaimed.  "Only yesterday
Aunt Fanny made exactly the same suggestion.
It must be something in the spring air."
</p>

<p>
"I don't always agree with Aunt Fanny," said
Guy, "but I think that for once in a way she was
giving you excellent advice.  A good wife would
make a tremendous difference in your life."
</p>

<p>
"Tremendous!" assented Tony with a shudder.
"I should probably have to give up smoking
in bed and come down to breakfast every
morning."
</p>

<p>
"You would be all the better for it," said Guy
firmly.  "I was thinking, however, more of your
general outlook on things.  Marriage with the right
woman might make you realize that your position
carries with it certain duties that you ought to regard
both as a privilege and a pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"Is going into Parliament one of them?" asked Tony.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  As a large landowner you are just
the type of man who is badly wanted in the House of
Commons."
</p>

<p>
"They must be devilish hard up for legislators,"
said Tony.  "Still, if you and Henry have made
up your minds, I expect I shall have to do it."  He
paused.  "I don't think I should like to be the
member for Balham North though," he added
reflectively.  "It sounds like the sort of place where
a chorus girl's mother would live."
</p>

<p>
Any defence of the constituency which Guy may
have had to offer was cut short by the re-entrance of
Spalding.
</p>

<p>
"The car is at the door, sir," he observed.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you going to finish your dinner?" inquired
Guy, as Tony pushed back his chair.
</p>

<p>
The latter shook his head.  "I never eat much
before a fight," he said.  "It prevents my getting
properly excited."  He got up from his seat.
"Besides," he added, "I always take Bugg round to
Shepherd's after he has knocked out his man, and we
celebrate the victory with stout and oysters.  It's
Bugg's idea of Heaven."
</p>

<p>
He passed out into the hall where Spalding helped
him on with his coat.  Outside the front door
stood a beautifully appointed Rolls-Royce limousine,
painted the colour of silver and upholstered in grey
Bedford cord.  Jennings was at the wheel and inside
sat Tiger Bugg and a large red-faced man with
little twinkling black eyes.  This latter was
Mr. "Blink" McFarland, the celebrated proprietor of the
Hampstead Heath Gymnasium, who acted as Tiger's
trainer and sparring partner.  They both touched
their caps as Tony appeared.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't let 'im get out, sir," observed McFarland
in a gruff voice.  "Might 'a took a chill hangin'
around."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, Blink," replied Tony gravely.
"Lopez isn't to be sneezed at even by a future
champion."
</p>

<p>
He lit himself a cigarette, and stepping inside
closed the door behind him.  Spalding made a signal
to Jennings and the big car slid off noiselessly down
the drive.
</p>

<p>
Tony turned to Bugg.  "Feeling all right?" he
inquired.
</p>

<p>
The young prize-fighter grinned amiably.  "Fine,
sir, thank ye, sir."
</p>

<p>
With an affectionate gesture, McFarland laid an
enormous mottled hand on his charge's knee.  "He's
fit to jump out of 'is skin, sir; you take it from me.
If he don't knock two sorts of blue 'ell out of that
dirty faced dago I'll give up trainin' fighters and
start keepin' rabbits."
</p>

<p>
"Lopez is supposed to have a bit of a punch
himself, isn't he?" inquired Tony.
</p>

<p>
McFarland made a hoarse rumbling noise which
was presumably intended for a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"All the better for us, sir.  The harder 'e hits the
more 'e'll hurt hisself.  It's a forlorn jog punchin'
Tiger.  You might as well kick a pavin' stone."
</p>

<p>
Bugg, who was evidently susceptible to compliments,
blushed like a schoolgirl, and then to cover
his confusion turned an embarrassed gaze out of the
window.  The long descent of Haverstock Hill was
flying past at a rare pace, for whatever might be
Jenning's shortcomings as a cheerful companion he
could certainly drive a car.  Indeed it could scarcely
have been more than ten minutes from the moment
they left the Heath, until, with a loud blast from
the horn, they glided round the corner of the street
into Covent Garden.
</p>

<p>
The pavement and roadway in front of the
Cosmopolitan were filled by the usual rough-looking
crowd that invariably congregates outside the Club
on the occasion of a big fight.  With surprising
swiftness, however, a space was cleared for Tony's
car, and as its three occupants stepped out, a hoarse
excited buzz of "That's 'im! that's Tiger!" rose up
all round them.
</p>

<p>
Bugg and McFarland hurried through into the
Club; Tony stopping behind for a moment to give
some directions to Jennings.
</p>

<p>
"You can put the car up at the R.A.C.," he said.
"I'll telephone over when I want you."
</p>

<p>
He followed the others across the pavement, amid
encouraging observations of, "Good-luck, me lord!"
and one or two approving pats on the back from
hearty if not overclean hands.
</p>

<p>
Bugg and his trainer had of course gone direct to
their dressing-room, where Tony made no attempt
to pursue them.  He knew that Tiger's preparations
were safe in McFarland's hands, so relinquishing his
coat to one of the hall porters, he walked straight
through to the big gymnasium where the Club
contests were held.
</p>

<p>
It was an animated scene that met his eyes as he
entered.  A preliminary bout was in progress and
round the raised and roped dais in the centre, with
its blinding glare of light overhead, sat a thousand or
fifteen hundred of London's most eminent
"sportsmen."  They were nearly all in evening dress: the
dazzling array of white shirt fronts and diamond
studs affording a vivid testimony to the interest
taken in pugilism by the most refined and educated
classes.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the round was ended, Tony made his
way slowly towards his seat by the ring-side, exchanging
innumerable greetings as he passed along.  Almost
everybody seemed to know him, and he seemed to
have a smile and a cheery word for them all.
</p>

<p>
A few yards from his destination he came across
the Marquis da Freitas.  That distinguished statesman
was seated in the front row of chairs enjoying
a big cigar, while beside him lounged a dark, squarely
built, rather coarse-featured youth, who greeted
Tony with an affable if slightly condescending wave
of his hand.  The latter was none other than His
Majesty King Pedro the Fifth, the rightful though
temporarily discarded ruler of Livadia.
</p>

<p>
Tony pulled up at this mark of Royal recognition
and shook hands with the Marquis and his monarch.
It was understood that on such occasions as the
present the ex-king preferred to be regarded as an
ordinary member of the Club.
</p>

<p>
"Everything is good I hope," he observed to Tony.
"Your man he is up to the scratch&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
He spoke English confidently, but with a marked
foreign accent.
</p>

<p>
"Rather," said Tony.  "Never been fitter in his
life.  No excuses if we're beaten."
</p>

<p>
Da Freitas blew out a philosophic puff of smoke.
"Ah, Sir Antony," he observed, "that is one of your
national virtues.  You are good losers, you English.
Perhaps you do not feel defeat as deeply as Southerners."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not," admitted Tony cheerfully.
"Anyhow, it's not much good making a song
about things, is it?  One's bound to strike a snag
occasionally."
</p>

<p>
The Marquis nodded.  "In Livadia," he said
softly, "we do not like to be beaten.  We&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There was a loud <i>tang</i> from the gong and the two
boxers sprang up out of their respective corners to
resume the fight.  With a gesture of apology Tony
moved along to his seat, where he found himself
next to "Doggy" Donaldson, who was discharging
his customary rôle of Master of the Ceremonies.
He welcomed Tony with a grip of the hand.
</p>

<p>
"Glad you've turned up," he said.  "I never feel
really happy till both parties are in the Club.  All
serene?"
</p>

<p>
"As far as we're concerned," replied Tony.
</p>

<p>
Donaldson rubbed his hands.  "That's good," he
observed contentedly.  "We'll have 'em in the ring
by nine-thirty at latest.  That'll just give us time
to&mdash;Hullo!  Look at that!  Damned if Young Alf
isn't chucking it."
</p>

<p>
One of the two contesting youths had suddenly
stepped back and held out his hand to his opponent.
He had just received a severe dig in the stomach,
which had apparently convinced him for the moment
that boxing was an unfriendly and over-rated amusement.
</p>

<p>
With a grunt of disgust at such pusillanimity
Donaldson clambered up into the ring, and in a
stentorian voice announced the name of the winner.
He then introduced two more lithe-limbed
active-looking lads, who promptly set about the task of
punching each other's heads with refreshing
accuracy and vigour.
</p>

<p>
It was about a quarter-past nine when this bout
came to an end, and preparations were begun for the
principal event.  Two buckets of clean water were
brought in, and a large cardboard box containing a
couple of new pairs of boxing-gloves was deposited
in the centre of the ring.  Then, while a truculent
looking gentleman in flannel trousers and a sweater
strolled about crushing lumps of resin beneath his
feet, Doggy Donaldson again hoisted himself into
the roped square, and held up his hand for silence.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," he said, "I have the pleasure to
announce that the Committee has decided to match
the winner of to-night's contest against Jack Rivers,
the holder of the Lonsdale Welter Weight Belt."
</p>

<p>
The applause that greeted this statement had
scarcely died away, when a louder and more enthusiastic
outburst proclaimed the appearance of the boxers.
They came on from different sides of the building
each with a small army of seconds in attendance.
Climbing up into opposite corners of the ring they
bowed their acknowledgments to the audience, and
then, after carefully rubbing their feet in the resin,
seated themselves on the small stools that had been
placed in readiness.
</p>

<p>
A number of lengthy preliminaries followed.  The
bandages that each man wore on his hands were
gravely inspected by one of his rival's seconds, while
another opened the cardboard box, and selected one
of the two pairs of gloves for his principal.  They
were nice-looking gloves, but to the casual observer
they would have appeared to be constructed more for
the purpose of conforming to the law than of really
deadening the effect of a blow.  By dint of much
pulling and straining, however, each boxer managed
to get them on, and then sat with a dressing-gown
over his shoulders while "Doggy" Donaldson made
the inevitable introductions.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen!  A twenty three-minute round contest
between 'Lightning' Lopez of Livadia on my
right, and 'Tiger' Bugg of Hampstead on my left.
The bout will be refereed by Mr. 'Dick' Fisher."
</p>

<p>
An elderly man in evening dress with a weather-beaten
face, hard blue eyes, and a chin like the toe
of a boot stepped up alongside the speaker and jerked
his head at the audience.  He was an ex-amateur
champion of England, and one of the best judges of
boxing in the world.
</p>

<p>
The gong sounded as a signal to clear the ring, and
the cluster of seconds each side made a leisurely
exit through the ropes.  For a moment the two
boxers were left sitting on their respective stools
facing each other across the brilliantly lighted arena.
Then came another clang, and with a simultaneous
movement they leaped lightly to their feet, and
advanced swiftly but cautiously towards the centre.
</p>

<p>
To any one sufficiently pagan to admire the human
form they made a pleasing and effective picture.
Both nude, except for a pair of very short blue trunks,
they moved forward with the lithe grace of a couple
of young panthers.  Under the pitiless glare of the
big arc lamps the rippling muscles on their backs
and shoulders were plainly visible.  Bugg's white
skin stood out in dazzling contrast to the swarthy
colour of his opponent, but as far as bodily perfection
went there seemed to be nothing to choose between
them.
</p>

<p>
For a few seconds they circled stealthily round
the ring sparring for an opening.  Lopez, who had
adopted a slightly crouching pose, was the more
aggressive of the two.  He was famed for the fierce
impetuousness of his methods, and on his last
appearance at the Club he had signalized the occasion by
knocking out his adversary in the second round.
</p>

<p>
In the present instance, however, he appeared to be
a little at a loss.  There was nothing very unusual
to the eye about Bugg's style, but the almost
contemptuous ease with which he brushed aside a couple
of lightning-like left leads was distinctly
disconcerting to his opponent.
</p>

<p>
Realizing apparently that as far as quickness and
skill went he had met more than his match, the
Livadian evidently decided that his usual robust
tactics might be the most effective.  He drew back a
pace, and then slightly dropping his head, sprang in
with the vicious fury of a wildcat, hitting out fiercely
with both hands.
</p>

<p>
The suddenness of the attack would have taken
most boxers by surprise, but that embarrassing
emotion appeared to have no place in Bugg's philosophy.
With the swiftness of light he stepped to one
side, and just as the human battering ram in front of
him hurled itself forward, he brought up his right
hand in a whizzing upper cut that caught his
adversary under the angle of the jaw.  The blow was so
perfectly timed and delivered with such tremendous
force that it lifted Lopez clean off his feet.  With his
arms flung out wide each side of him he made a sort
of convulsive jerk into the air, and then crashed
over backwards on to the floor, where he lay a huddled
and inert mass.
</p>

<p>
For an instant the whole house remained hushed
in a stupefied silence.  Then as the time-keeper
began to count off the fateful seconds a sudden
hoarse roar broke out all over the building.  Above
the din could be heard the voices of Lopez' seconds,
howling abuse and entreaty at their unconscious
principal.  In vain the referee waved his arms,
entreating some sort of order for the count.
</p>

<p>
"Doggy" Donaldson clutched Tony by the wrist.
"Damn it!" he shouted excitedly, "I believe he's
broken his neck."
</p>

<p>
Even as he spoke came the clang of the time-keeper's
gong, signifying that the ten seconds had
passed.  In a moment half a dozen figures were
swarming over the ropes, but before any one of them
could reach him, Bugg had picked up his limp,
unconscious adversary in his arms, and was carrying
him across the ring to his own corner.  He seemed
to be by far the coolest and most collected person
present.
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately Tony became the centre of
a number of friends and acquaintances who were
wringing his hand and congratulating him on the
victory.  After a minute or two he managed to free
himself, and pushing his way through to the ringside,
inquired anxiously after the health of the
unfortunate Lopez.  "Doggy" Donaldson, who was
amongst the crowd surrounding that fallen warrior,
bent down with an air of considerable relief upon
his honest countenance.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," he said, "the beggar's coming
round.  I really thought for a moment he was a
goner though.  Gad, what a kick that boy of yours
has got!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm glad it's no worse," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
The other nodded.  "Yes," he observed, "we
must all be thankful for that.  It would have been
a rotten thing for the Club if he'd broken his neck."
</p>

<p>
He turned away, and following suit, Tony suddenly
found himself face to face with the Marquis
da Freitas, and his royal master, who had apparently
stepped forward in order to learn the news.  The
Marquis appeared as suave as ever, but anything
more sulky looking than His Majesty it would have
been difficult to imagine.
</p>

<p>
Da Freitas bowed with the faintest ironical
exaggeration.  "Permit me to congratulate you,
Sir Antony.  Your victory is indeed crushing."
</p>

<p>
Tony regarded him with his usual amiable smile.
"Thanks," he said.  "I am awfully glad your man
isn't seriously hurt.  It was bad luck his running
into a punch like that."  He turned to Pedro.
"You can have a return match you know any time,
if you care about it."
</p>

<p>
His Majesty scowled.  "I will see him dead before
I back him again," he observed bitterly.
</p>

<p>
The Marquis da Freitas showed his white teeth
in a polite smile.  "I fear you are rather too strong
for us in the boxing-ring, Sir Antony.  Perhaps
some day we may find a more favourable battle-ground."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," said Tony.  "I rather like having
a shade of odds against me.  It's so much more
interesting."
</p>

<p>
He nodded cheerfully to the pair of them, and
moving off from the ring-side began to make his way
across the hall.  It was slow work, for friends kept
on pulling him up with boisterous words of congratulation,
while several of them made strenuous endeavours
to persuade him to join a party at some
neighbouring night club, to which they were going
on for supper.
</p>

<p>
Tony, however, declined the invitation on the
plea of a previous engagement.  As he had told Guy
at dinner it was his invariable custom after a
successful fight to take Bugg out to Shepherd's, the
celebrated oyster bar in Coventry Street&mdash;a resort much
frequented by gentlemen of pugilistic and sporting
tastes.  The simple-minded Tiger had not many
weaknesses, but on these occasions it afforded him
such extreme pleasure to be seen therewith his patron,
that Tony wouldn't have missed gratifying him for
the most festive supper party in London.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the dressing-room he found Bugg
fully clothed and in the centre of a small levee of
pressmen and fellow pugilists.  McFarland,
immensely in his element, was dispensing champagne
to the visitors, and explaining how very lately his own
unrivalled training methods had contributed to the
result.
</p>

<p>
Tony stopped and chatted amiably for a few
minutes until he could manage to extract Bugg from
the centre of his admirers.  When at last they
succeeded in getting away they slipped out quietly
by the side door of the Club in order to avoid the
crowd who were still hanging about the front, and
with a breath of relief found themselves in the cool
night air of Long Acre.
</p>

<p>
Tony lit a cigarette and offered one to his companion.
</p>

<p>
"You positively surpassed yourself to-night,
Bugg," he said.  "The worst of it is that if you go
on improving in this way, I shall have to find a
new profession.  No one will dare to bet against you."
</p>

<p>
"I 'ope I didn't shove it across 'im too sudden,
sir?" inquired Bugg anxiously.  "You said you was
in a hurry."
</p>

<p>
"It was perfect," said Tony.  "The only person
who had any complaint to make was King Pedro."
</p>

<p>
Bugg sniffed contemptuously.  "'E ain't much of
a king, sir.  I don't wonder they give 'im the chuck.
A real king wouldn't taike on abaht droppin' a few
quids."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay you're right," said Tony.  "A certain
recklessness in finance&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He suddenly pulled up and for a moment remained
where he was, staring across the street.  On the
opposite pavement, in the bright circle of light
thrown by one of the big electric standards, he had
caught sight of the figure of a girl, who at that
distance reminded him curiously of Molly Monk.  She
had apparently just come out of the entrance to
some flats above, and with a bag in her hand she was
standing there in an uncertain, indefinite sort of way,
as though she scarcely knew what to do next.
</p>

<p>
Realizing that it couldn't be Molly, who was of
course at the theatre, Tony was just about to move
on again, when something checked him.
</p>

<p>
Two well-dressed men in dark overcoats and soft
hats had suddenly appeared out of the shadow ahead
and advanced quickly to where the girl was standing.
For an instant they all three remained facing each
other under the light, and then taking off his hat, one
of them addressed her.
</p>

<p>
With a little frightened gesture the girl shrank
back against the wall, where she glanced wildly
round as though seeking for some means of escape.
The man who had spoken followed her forward, his
hat still in his hand, apparently making an effort
to reassure her.
</p>

<p>
Tony turned to Bugg.  "We really can't allow
this sort of thing in Long Acre," he observed.  "It
has always been a most respectable street."
</p>

<p>
He threw away his cigarette, and followed by
the future champion of England started off briskly
across the road.
</p>

<p>
On hearing their footsteps the two men spun
round with some abruptness.  They were both
obviously foreigners, and the sight of their sallow
faces and black moustaches filled Tony with a
pleasant sense of patriotic morality.
</p>

<p>
Without paying any attention to either of them
he walked straight up to the girl, and taking off his
hat made her a slight bow.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," he said, "but from the other
side of the road it looked as if these gentlemen were
annoying you.  Can I be of any assistance?"
</p>

<p>
She gazed up at him with grateful eyes.  At close
quarters her resemblance to Molly, though still
remarkable, was not quite so convincing.  She was a
little younger and slighter, and there was a delicate
air of distinction about her that was entirely her
own.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if you would be so kind," she said in a
delightfully soft voice.  "I do not wish to speak with
these men.  If you could send them away&mdash;right
away&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," replied Tony with his most
cheerful smile, "please don't distress yourself."
</p>

<p>
He turned to the two sallow-faced strangers who
seemed to have been utterly disconcerted by his
sudden appearance on the scene.
</p>

<p>
"Go away," he said, "and hurry up about it."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
LIKE A FAIRY STORY
</h3>

<p>
There was a short pause, and then the shorter of
the two men stepped forward.  He was an aggressive
looking person with a cast in his eye, and he spoke
with a slight foreign accent.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," he said, "you are making a mistake.  We
do not intend any insult to this lady.  We are indeed
her best friends.  If you will be good enough to
withdraw&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
With the gleam of battle in his eye, Bugg ranged up
alongside the speaker, and tapped him on the elbow.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere!" he observed.  "You 'eard wot the guv'nor
said, didn't you?"  He jerked his thumb over his
left shoulder.  "'Op it before you get 'urt."
</p>

<p>
Tony turned to the girl.  "You mustn't be mixed
up in a street fight," he said.  "If you will allow
me to see you to a taxi, my friend here will prevent
these unpleasant looking people from following us."
</p>

<p>
He offered her his arm, and after a second's
hesitation she laid a small gloved hand upon his
sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"It is very kind of you," she faltered.  "I fear I
am going to give you a great deal of trouble."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," replied Tony.  "I love interfering
in other people's affairs."
</p>

<p>
With a swift stride the cross-eyed gentleman
thrust himself across their path.
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" he exclaimed vehemently.  "You must
not listen to this man.  You&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
With a powerful thrust of his disengaged arm
Tony sent him staggering back to the edge of the
pavement, where he stumbled over the curb and sat
down heavily in the gutter.
</p>

<p>
His companion, seeing his fall, gave a guttural
cry of anger and lifting the light stick that he was
carrying lashed out savagely at Bugg.  As coolly as
if he were in the ring the latter ducked under the
blow, and coming up with a beautiful straight left
knocked his assailant spinning against the lamp-post.
</p>

Tony sent the fellow staggering back to the edge of the pavement. 
His companion lashed out savagely at Bugg. The latter ducked under 
the blow, and coming up with a beautiful straight left, knocked 
his assailant spinning. Tony turned again to the girl.  
&quot;I am afraid we must tear ourselves away,&quot; he remarked.  
&quot;We shall have half London here in a moment.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Tony turned again to the girl at his side.  "I am
afraid we must tear ourselves away," he remarked.
"We shall have half London here in a moment."
</p>

<p>
Already from down the street came the shrill blast
of a whistle, followed a moment later by the sound
of running footsteps.  Heedless of these warnings the
two strangers, now apparently reckless with fury,
were collecting themselves for a fresh attack.
</p>

<p>
"Keep them busy, Bugg," said Tony quietly;
and the next instant he and the girl were hurrying
along the pavement in the direction of Martin's Lane.
That fairly prosperous thoroughfare was only a few
yards' distant, but before they could reach it the
sounds of a magnificent tumult broke out again
behind them.  The girl glanced nervously over her
shoulder, and her grip on Tony's arm tightened.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she gasped, "oughtn't we to go back?
Your friend will be hurt!"
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed reassuringly.  "If any one's hurt,"
he observed, "it's much more likely to be one of the
other gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
They rounded the corner, and as they did so a
disengaged taxi came bowling opportunely up the
street.  Tony signalled to the driver to stop.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are!" he said.
</p>

<p>
A look of frightened dismay leaped suddenly into
his companion's pretty face.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" asked Tony.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I forgot," she stammered.  "I can't take a
taxi.  I&mdash;I haven't any money with me."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's pause, while the driver bent
forward from his box listening with interest to the
spirited echoes from Long Acre.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," remarked Tony.  "We will
talk about it in the cab."  He turned to the driver.
"Take us to Verrier's," he said.  It was the first
place that happened to come into his head.
</p>

<p>
The man jerked his head in the direction of the
noise.  "Bit of a scrap on from the sound of it, sir!"
he observed.
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "Yes," he said regretfully, "it's a
quarrelsome world."
</p>

<p>
He helped his companion into the taxi, and then
following himself, shut the door.  The vehicle started
off with a jerk, and as it swung round the corner into
Coventry Street, its occupants were able to catch a
momentary glimpse of the spot they had so recently
quitted.  It appeared to be filled by a small but
animated crowd, in the centre of which a cluster of
whirling figures was distinctly visible.  Tony heard
the girl beside him give a faint gasp of dismay.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," he said.  "Bugg's used to fighting.
He likes it."
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him anxiously.  "He is a soldier?"
she asked, in that soft attractive voice of
hers.
</p>

<p>
Tony suppressed a laugh just in time.  "Something
of the sort," he answered.  Then with a pleasant
feeling that the whole adventure was becoming
rather interesting he added: "I say, I have told the
man to drive us to Verrier's.  I hope if you aren't
in a hurry you will be charitable and join me in a
little supper&mdash;will you?  I'm simply starving."
</p>

<p>
By the light of a passing street lamp he suddenly
caught sight of the troubled expression that had come
into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Do just what you like, of course," he added
quickly.  "If you would rather I drove you straight
home&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact," said the girl with a sort of
desperate calmness.  "I haven't a home to go to."
</p>

<p>
There was another brief pause.  "Well, in that
case," remarked Tony cheerfully, "there is no possible
objection to our having a little supper&mdash;is there?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment she stared out of the window without
replying.  It was plain that she was the prey of
several contradictory emotions, of which a vague
restless fear seemed to be the most prominent.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what to do," she said unhappily.
"You are very kind, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There is only one possible thing to do," interrupted
Tony firmly, "and that is to come to Verrier's.
We can discuss the next step when we get there."
</p>

<p>
Even as he spoke the taxi swerved across the road,
and drew up in front of the famous underground
restaurant.
</p>

<p>
Before getting out the girl threw a quick hunted
glance from side to side of the street.  "Do you
think either of those men have followed us?" she
whispered.
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head comfortingly.  "From what
I know of Bugg," he said, "I should regard it as
highly improbable."
</p>

<p>
He settled up with the driver, and then strolling
across the pavement, rejoined the girl, who was
waiting for him just outside the entrance.  She had
evidently made a great effort to recover her
self-composure, for she looked up at him with a brave
if slightly forced smile.
</p>

<p>
"I must make myself tidy," she said, "if you
won't mind waiting a minute.  I am simply not fit
to be seen."
</p>

<p>
The statement appeared to be exaggerated to
Tony, but he allowed it to pass unchallenged.
</p>

<p>
"Please don't hurry," he said.  "I want to use
the telephone, and if I finish first I can brood over
what we'll have for supper."
</p>

<p>
She smiled again&mdash;this time more naturally, and
taking the dressing-bag that he had been carrying
for her, disappeared into the cloak-room.  Tony
abandoned his hat and coat to a waiter, and then
sauntering forward, entered the restaurant.
</p>

<p>
The moment he appeared the manager, who was
standing on the other side of the room, hastened
across to greet him.
</p>

<p>
"Bon soir, Sir Antony," he observed with that
dazzling smile of welcome that managers only
produce for their most wealthy customers.  "May I
'ave ze pleasiare of finding you a table."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded indulgently.  "You may, Gustave,"
he said: "A table for two with flowers on it, and as
far away from the band as possible."  He paused.
"Also," he added, "I want a really nice little supper.
Something with imagination about it.  The sort of
supper that you would offer to an angel if you
unexpectedly found one with an appetite."
</p>

<p>
The manager bowed with a gesture of perfect
comprehension.
</p>

<p>
"And while you are wrestling with the problem,"
said Tony, "I should like to use the telephone if I
may."
</p>

<p>
He was shown into the private office, where, in
response to polite and repeated requests, a lady at
the Exchange eventually found leisure to connect
him with Shepherd's Oyster Bar.
</p>

<p>
"Is Mr. 'Tiger' Bugg there?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
The man who had answered the call departed to
have a look round, and then returned with the
information that so far Mr. Bugg had not put in an
appearance.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if he does come," said Tony, "will you tell
him for me&mdash;Sir Antony Conway&mdash;that I shall not
be able to join him.  He can pick up the car at the
R.A.C."
</p>

<p>
The man promised to deliver the message, and ringing
off, Tony strolled back through the restaurant
to the place where he had parted from his charming
if slightly mysterious companion.  He met her just
coming out of the cloak-room.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I hope I haven't kept you very long," she
said penitently.
</p>

<p>
Tony looked down into the clear amber eyes that
were turned up to his own, and thought that she was
even prettier than he had at first imagined.
</p>

<p>
"I have only just this moment finished telephoning,"
he said.  "The Central Exchange are like the
gods.  They never hurry."
</p>

<p>
She laughed softly, and then, as the waiter on duty
opened the door with a low bow, they walked forward
into the restaurant.
</p>

<p>
M. Gustave, more affable than ever, came up to
conduct them to their table.
</p>

<p>
At the sight of the charming arrangement in
maidenhair and narcissi which decorated the centre,
the girl gave a little exclamation of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"But how beautiful!" she said.  "I never knew
English restaurants&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She stopped short as though she suddenly thought
the remark were better unfinished.
</p>

<p>
Tony took no notice of her slight embarrassment.
"I am glad you like flowers," he said.  "It's such a
nice primitive, healthy taste.  Since Mr. Chamberlain
died I believe I am the only person in London
who still wears a button-hole."
</p>

<p>
They sat down on opposite sides of the table, and
for the first time he was able to enjoy a complete
and leisurely survey of his companion.
</p>

<p>
She was younger than he had thought at first&mdash;a
mere girl of seventeen or eighteen&mdash;with the
complexion of a wild rose, and the lithe, slender figure of
a forest dryad.  It was her red hair and the little
firm, delicately moulded chin which gave her that
curious superficial resemblance to Molly which had
originally attracted his attention.  He saw now that
there were several differences between them&mdash;one of
the most noticeable being the colour of their eyes.
Molly's were blue&mdash;blue as the sky, while this girl's
were of clear deep amber, like the water of some still
pool in the middle of a moorland stream.
</p>

<p>
What charmed him most of all, however, was the
faint air of sensitive pride that hung about her
like some fragrant perfume.  Although obviously
frightened and apparently in a very awkward
predicament, she was yet facing the situation with
nervous thoroughbred courage that filled Tony with
admiration.
</p>

<p>
One thing struck him as rather incongruous.  She
had said she had no money, and yet even to his masculine
eyes it was quite clear that the clothes she was
wearing, though simple in appearance, could
have been made by a most expensive dressmaker.
On the little finger of her left hand he also noticed
a sapphire and diamond ring which if real must be
of considerable value.  All this combined to fill
him with an agreeable and stimulating curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you are feeling none the worse for our
wild adventures," he said, as the waiter withdrew,
after handing them the first course.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "You have been extraordinarily
kind," she said in a low voice.  "I have
a great deal to thank you for.  I&mdash;I hardly know how
to begin."
</p>

<p>
"Well, suppose we begin by introducing ourselves,"
he suggested cheerfully.  "My name is
Conway&mdash;Sir Antony Conway.  My more intimate
friends are occasionally permitted to call me
Tony."
</p>

<p>
She hesitated a second before replying.  "My
name is Isabel," she said.  "Isabel Francis," she
added a little lamely.
</p>

<p>
"I shall call you 'Isabel' if I may," said Tony.
"'Miss Francis' sounds so unromantic after the
thrilling way in which we became friends."
</p>

<p>
He paused until the waiter, who had bustled up
again with a bottle of champagne had filled their
respective glasses and retired.
</p>

<p>
"And as we have become friends," he continued,
"don't you think you can tell me how you have
managed to get yourself into this&mdash;what shall we
call it&mdash;scrape?  I am not asking just out of mere
curiosity.  I should like to help you if I can.  You
see I am always in scrapes myself, so I might be able
to give you some good advice."
</p>

<p>
The gleam of fun in his eyes, and the friendly way
in which he spoke, seemed to take away much of
his companion's nervousness.  She sipped her champagne,
looking at him over the top of the glass with a
simple, almost childish gratitude.
</p>

<p>
"You have been kind and nice," she said frankly.
"I don't know what I should have done if you hadn't
been there."  She put down her glass.  "You see,"
she went on in a slower and more hesitating way,
"I&mdash;I came up to London this evening to stay with
an old governess of mine who has a flat in Long Acre.
When I got there I found she had gone away, and
then I didn't know what to do, because I hadn't
brought any money with me."
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't she expecting you?" asked Tony.
</p>

<p>
Miss "Isabel Francis" shook her head.  "No-o,"
she admitted.  "You see I hadn't time to write and
tell her I was coming."  She paused.  "I&mdash;I left
home rather in a hurry," she added naïvely.
</p>

<p>
Tony leaned back in his chair and looked at her
with a smile.  He was enjoying himself immensely.
</p>

<p>
"And our two yellow-faced friends in evening-dress,"
he asked.  "Were they really old acquaintances
of yours?"
</p>

<p>
The frightened, hunted look flashed back into her
eyes.  "No, no," she said quickly.  "I had never
seen them before in my life.  I had just left the flats
when they came up and spoke to me.  They were
both strangers&mdash;quite absolutely strangers."
</p>

<p>
She spoke eagerly, as though specially anxious
that her words should carry conviction, but somehow
or other Tony felt a little sceptical.  He couldn't
forget the fierce persistence of the two men, which
seemed quite out of keeping with the idea that they
had been interrupted in a mere piece of wanton
impertinence.  Besides, if what she said about them
were true it would hardly account for her unreasoning
terror that they might have followed her to the
restaurant.  Being polite by nature, however, he was
careful to show no sign of doubting her statement.
</p>

<p>
He allowed the waiter to help them both to some
attractive looking mystery in aspic, and then, when
they were again alone, he leaned forward and
observed with sympathy:
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm glad we happened to roll up at the
right time.  It's always jolly to give that sort
of gentlemen a lesson in manners."  He paused.
"Have you made any kind of plans about what you
are going to do next?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "I&mdash;I haven't quite decided,"
she said.  "I suppose I must find some place
to stay at until Miss Watson comes back."
</p>

<p>
"How long will that be?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  You see she has just gone away
and shut up the flat, and left no address."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you any other friends in London?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head again.  "Nobody," she said,
"at least nobody who could help me."  Then she
hesitated.  "I have lived in Paris nearly all my
life," she added by way of explanation.
</p>

<p>
There was a brief silence.
</p>

<p>
"If you will forgive my mentioning such a sordid
topic," remarked Tony pleasantly, "what do you
propose to do about money?"
</p>

<p>
"I can get some money to-morrow," she answered.
"I can sell some jewellery&mdash;this ring for
instance&mdash;and there are other things in my bag."
</p>

<p>
"And to-night?"
</p>

<p>
She glanced round rather desperately.  "I don't
know.  I must go somewhere.  I was thinking
that perhaps I could sit in one of the
churches&mdash;or there might be a convent&mdash;"  She broke off
with a little glance, as if appealing to Tony for his
advice.
</p>

<p>
"Why not go to a hotel?" he suggested.  "If
you will allow me, I will lend you some money, and
you can pay me back when it's convenient."
</p>

<p>
She flushed slightly.  "Oh!" she stammered,
"you are so kind.  Perhaps if I could find some quite
quiet place&mdash;"  She stopped again, but looking at
her, Tony could see the old hunted expression still
lurking in her eyes.  Somehow he felt certain that
she was thinking about the two strangers.
</p>

<p>
A sudden brilliant idea suggested itself to him.
"Look here!" he exclaimed.  "How would this do?
My butler's wife&mdash;Mrs. Spalding&mdash;has got a small
house just off Heath Street, Hampstead.  I know
she lets rooms and I am pretty nearly sure that just
at present there is no one there.  Why shouldn't
we run up in the car and have a look at the place?
She could fix you up for the night anyway, and if you
find you like it you can stay on there till your
Miss&mdash;Miss Thingumbob comes back."
</p>

<p>
A naturally distrustful nature was evidently not
one of Isabel's characteristics, for she received the
proposal with the most frank and genuine gratitude.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she cried, "that would be nice!  But won't
she be asleep by now?"
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter if she is," said Tony tranquilly.
"We will pick up Spalding on the way and take him
round with us to rout her out.  If she feels peevish
at being waked up, she can let the steam off on him
first."
</p>

<p>
He beckoned to the waiter and asked that
accomplished henchman to ring up the R.A.C. and
instruct Jennings to bring the car round to Verrier's.
</p>

<p>
"And find out," he added, "whether 'Tiger' Bugg
has turned up there or not."
</p>

<p>
The waiter departed on his mission, coming back in
a few minutes with the information that the car
would be round at once, and that so far Mr. 'Tiger'
Bugg had neither been seen nor heard of.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder where he can be," said Tony to his
companion.  "He can't possibly have taken all this
time to slaughter a couple of dagoes.  I am afraid the
police must have interfered."
</p>

<p>
The suggestion seemed to fill Isabel with a certain
amount of dismay.
</p>

<p>
"The police!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands.
"Oh, but I hope not.  He is so brave he would have
fought with them, and perhaps they may have killed
him."
</p>

<p>
The picture of a desperately resisting Bugg
being hacked to pieces on the pavement by infuriated
bobbies appealed hugely to Tony's sense of
humour.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it's likely," he said in a reassuring
tone.  "The English police as a whole are very
good-natured.  They seldom take life except in
self-defence."
</p>

<p>
He added one or two other items of information
with regard to Bugg's hardihood and fertility of
resource, which seemed to comfort Isabel, and then,
with the latter's permission, he lighted a cigarette and
called for his bill.
</p>

<p>
He was just settling it when news came that the
car had arrived.  He instructed the waiter to place
Isabel's bag inside, and then bidding good-night to
the bowing and valedictory M. Gustave, they walked
upstairs to the entrance.
</p>

<p>
They found the big gleaming Rolls-Royce drawn
up by the curb with Jennings standing in a joyless
attitude at the door.  When his glance fell on Isabel
he looked more pessimistic than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Any news of Bugg?" inquired Tony.
</p>

<p>
The chauffeur shook his head.  "Not a word, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I left a message at Shepherd's that he was to
come and pick you up at the Club.  I wonder what's
happened to him."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Jennings brooded darkly over the
problem.  "Perhaps he got some internal injury in
the fight and was took sudden with it in the street,"
he suggested.  "I could run round the 'orspitals and
make inquiries if you wished, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Jennings," said Tony.  "You are
very helpful; but I think I should prefer to go back
to Hampstead."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please, sir," observed Jennings indifferently.
</p>

<p>
He closed the door after them, and then mounting
the driving-seat, started off along Piccadilly.
</p>

<p>
Isabel, who had again cast a quick glance out of
each window, turned to Tony with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't seem a very cheerful man, your
chauffeur," she said.  "He has got such a sad voice."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "That's the reason I originally
engaged him.  I like to have a few miserable people
about the place: they help me to realize how happy
I am myself."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed merrily.  The solution of her
difficulties in the way of a lodging seemed to have
taken an immense weight off her spirits, and in the
agreeably shaded light of the big limousine she looked
younger and prettier than ever.  So far his new
adventure struck Tony as being quite the most
interesting and promising he had ever embarked on.
</p>

<p>
As the car glided on through the depressing
architecture of Camden Town he began to tell her
in a cheerful inconsequent sort of fashion something
about his house and general surroundings.  She
listened with the utmost interest, the whole thing
evidently striking her as being highly novel and
entertaining.
</p>

<p>
"And do you live quite by yourself?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Quite," said Tony.  "Except for Spalding and
Jennings and Bugg and a cook and two or three
maid-servants and dear old Guy!"
</p>

<p>
"Who's Guy?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Guy," he said, "can be best described as being
Guy.  In addition to that he is also my cousin and
my secretary."
</p>

<p>
"Your secretary?" she repeated.  "Why, what
does he do?"
</p>

<p>
"His chief occupation is doing my tenants," said
Tony.  "In his spare time he gives me good advice
which I never follow.  You must come to breakfast
to-morrow and make his acquaintance."
</p>

<p>
The car turned in at the drive gates of "Goodman's
Rest," which was the felicitous name that Tony
had selected for his house, and drew up outside the
front entrance.
</p>

<p>
"I will just see if Spalding has gone to bed," he
said to Isabel.  "If not it's hardly worth while your
getting out."
</p>

<p>
He opened the door with his key and entering the
hall, which was lighted softly by concealed electric
lamps, pressed a bell alongside the fireplace.  Almost
immediately a door swung open at the back and
Spalding appeared on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Good," said Tony, "I thought you might have
turned in."
</p>

<p>
"I was about to do so, Sir Antony," replied
Spalding impassively.  "May I mention how pleased
we all were at the news of Bugg's success."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you have heard about it!" remarked Tony.
"Is Bugg back then?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  I took the liberty of ringing up the
Cosmopolitan.  The Cook had a half-crown on, sir,
and she was almost painfully anxious to ascertain
the result."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded his approval.  "After the way she
grilled that sole to-night," he said, "I would deny
her nothing."  He paused.  "Spalding," he added:
"are you frightened of your wife?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," replied Spalding.  "At least not more
than most husbands, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I want you to come and act as my ambassador.
There is a young lady in the motor outside
who is in need of somewhere to sleep and some kind
and sensible person to look after her.  I know
Mrs. Spalding lets rooms, and although it's rather a queer
time of night to receive a new lodger, I thought that
if you came and put the case to her tactfully, she
might stretch a point to oblige me."
</p>

<p>
Spalding's face remained beautifully expressionless.
"I am sure my wife would do anything to
oblige you, sir," he observed.  "If you will excuse
my saying so, you stand very high in her good
opinion, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said Tony.  "I am afraid you must be
an extraordinarily deceitful husband, Spalding."
</p>

<p>
The butler bowed.  "I make a point, sir, of only
repeating incidents which seem to me likely to appeal
to her."
</p>

<p>
"A very excellent habit," said Tony gravely.
"Get on your hat and coat, and we will see how it
works out in practice."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, with Spalding sitting on the
front seat alongside of Jennings, they were retracing
their way across the Heath.  On reaching the main
thoroughfare they turned up one of the little steep
streets that run off to the right, and came to a halt
in front of an old-fashioned row of small white
houses, standing back behind narrow slips of garden.
</p>

<p>
Spalding opened the gate for them, and then
leading the way up the path, let them in at the front
door with a latch-key.  A feeble flicker of gas was
burning in the hall.
</p>

<p>
"If you will wait in here, sir," he observed,
opening a door on the right, "I will go upstairs and
acquaint my wife with your arrival."
</p>

<p>
The room he showed them into, though small in
size and simply furnished, was a remarkably pleasant
little apartment.  In the first place, everything
was scrupulously clean, and the general impression
of cheerful freshness was heightened by a couple of
bowls of hyacinths in full bloom which stood on a
table in the window.
</p>

<p>
"How does this appeal to the taste of Isabel?"
inquired Tony, lighting himself another cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Why it's charming!" she exclaimed.  "I shall be
so happy if I can stay here.  It all seems so free and
lovely after&mdash;" she checked herself&mdash;"after where I
have been living," she finished.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope it will all be up to sample," said
Tony, "I can't imagine Spalding being content with
anything second rate&mdash;at least judging by his taste
in wine and cigars."  He paused.  "What time
would you like breakfast in the morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Breakfast?" she repeated.
</p>

<p>
"I always call it breakfast," explained Tony.  "It
is such a much healthier sounding word than lunch.
Suppose I send the car round for you about eleven?
Would that be too early?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, smiling.  "I expect I could
manage it," she said.  "You see I generally get
up at eight o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"We could have it a little earlier if you like,"
remarked Tony unselfishly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," she answered.  "I shall probably enjoy
lying in bed to-morrow."  Then with a little laugh
she added: "But surely I can walk round.  It's
quite a short distance isn't it, and all across the nice
Heath?"
</p>

<p>
"Just as you like," said Tony.  "I shall send
the car any way.  The morning air is so good for
Jennings."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke there was a sound of footsteps on the
stairs, and a moment later Spalding re-entered the
room.
</p>

<p>
"My wife asks me to say, sir, that she will be
very pleased to make the young lady as comfortable
as possible.  She is coming downstairs herself
as soon as we have withdrawn.  Owing to
the lateness of the hour she is slightly&mdash;h'm&mdash;<i>en
déshabillé</i>."
</p>

<p>
"We will retire in good order," said Tony gravely.
Then as Spalding tactfully left the room he turned to
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, Isabel," he said.  "Sleep peacefully,
and don't dream that you are being chased
by yellow-faced strangers."
</p>

<p>
She gave him her little slim cool hand, and he
raised it lightly to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night," she answered, "and thank you,
thank you again so much."  Then she paused.
"It's just like a fairy story, isn't it?" she added.
</p>

<p>
"Just," said Tony with enthusiasm.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
THE LENIENCY OF JUSTICE
</h3>

<p>
As the clock above the mantelpiece struck eleven,
Guy Oliver wiped his pen and laid it carefully down
in front of him.  He was sitting at a roll-top desk in
his office&mdash;a room of severely business-like aspect,
chiefly furnished with maps and filing cabinets.
</p>

<p>
With that systematic deliberation that marked all
his movements he extracted a document from the
pigeon-hole in front of him and rising to his feet
walked across to the door.  In the passage outside
a neatly dressed housemaid was engaged in the task
of polishing the banisters.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know if Sir Antony is up yet, Mary?" he
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"He has been up some little time, sir," answered
the girl.  "I believe you will find him in the study.
I heard him telling Mr. Spalding to lay breakfast
in there, instead of in the dining-room."
</p>

<p>
With a look of mild surprise upon his face, Guy
pursued his way downstairs.  He crossed the hall,
and opening the door of the study remained for a
moment on the threshold, contemplating the scene
in front of him.
</p>

<p>
A black oak gate-legged table, gleaming with
flowers, fruit, and silver, stood out attractively in the
centre of the room, while the spring sunshine, streaming
in through the open French window, bathed everything
in its warm, inspiriting rays.  Tony himself
looking delightfully cool and serene in a perfectly
cut grey morning suit, was lounging on the broad
window-seat gazing out into the garden.
</p>

<p>
He turned round at Guy's entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, old chap!" he observed pleasantly: "just
out of bed?"
</p>

<p>
Guy took no notice of this irreverent question.
He advanced to the table, and adjusting his
pince-nez, carefully inspected its contents.
</p>

<p>
"If you will forgive my saying so, Tony," he
remarked, "you are becoming shamelessly greedy.
Where on earth did you get these peaches and
hothouse grapes from?"
</p>

<p>
"I sent Jennings into Harrod's for them,"
answered Tony.  "A little morning exercise is good for
him, and I have a friend coming to breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Guy.  "Any one I know?"
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "I don't think so.  In fact
we only became acquainted ourselves last night."
</p>

<p>
"One of your curious sporting acquaintances, I
suppose?" observed Guy with a faint touch of
disapproval.
</p>

<p>
Tony smiled pensively.  "Yes," he said, "on the
whole I think we may pass the description.  If you
will wait and have breakfast with us I shall be
charmed to introduce you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much," said Guy, "but I had my
breakfast a couple of hours ago.  Besides I am
rather busy this morning."  He produced the paper
which he had brought down from the office.  "I
wanted to catch you before you went out, to get
you to sign this.  It's the agreement with Marshall
I spoke to you about on Thursday.  You had
better look it through."
</p>

<p>
Tony pulled a fountain pen out of his inside pocket.
"My dear Guy!" he said.  "I should never dream
of reading a document that you had passed as
accurate.  It would be a reflection on your sobriety."
</p>

<p>
He scribbled his name in the appointed place and
handed the paper back to his cousin.
</p>

<p>
"I see in the <i>Daily Mail</i> this morning that Bugg
won his fight all right," remarked the latter.  "What
time did you get back?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> got back at a most respectable hour," said
Tony.  "I am sorry to say I managed to lose Bugg."
</p>

<p>
"Lose him!" echoed Guy.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Tony.  "You know how careless I
am.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was interrupted by a knock at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Come in," he called out.
</p>

<p>
The door opened and Spalding advanced with
dignity across the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Francis," he announced.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's pause and then, looking
slightly embarrassed but most refreshingly beautiful,
Isabel appeared in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
Tony who had jumped to his feet came forward
and took her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Isabel," he said.  "How wonderfully
punctual you are!  You must have been very
well brought up."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, smiling shyly.  "I am afraid
it is only because I am hungry," she said.  "As a
rule I am late for everything."
</p>

<p>
"We ought to get along together famously,"
replied Tony.  "Let's see, you don't know Guy yet,
do you?  Guy, let me introduce you to Isabel.  I
have already acquainted her with some of your
better and brighter qualities."
</p>

<p>
Guy, whose face was an interesting study in
blended emotions, made a little stiff bow.
</p>

<p>
"I have been trying to persuade him to stay and
have breakfast with us," proceeded Tony
mischievously, "but he says he doesn't care about my
curious sporting friends."
</p>

<p>
With a spasmodic gesture Guy took a step forward.
"Really I&mdash;I protest," he stammered.  "You
mustn't listen to him, Miss Francis.  It is a gross
misrepresentation."
</p>

<p>
"I am quite sure you wouldn't say anything
disagreeable, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Guy," replied Isabel
consolingly.  "You have much too kind a face."
</p>

<p>
Guy crimsoned vividly, and with a gentle chuckle
Tony relieved Isabel of her coat.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you be deceived," he said.  "You should
hear the brutal way he addresses my tenants when
they want something done to their houses."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do shut up, Tony," remonstrated Guy.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you really going to stay to breakfast?"
asked Isabel, inspecting the table.  "There seems
to be such a lot for two."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I am afraid I can't," said Guy with some
embarrassment.  "I should be delighted to, but&mdash;I
have some work I must get done."  He turned to
Tony.  "By the way, there was a note from Henry
this morning saying that if you were going to be at
home to-night he would like to come to dinner.  He
wants me to ring him up and let him know."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose we may as well get it over," said Tony
sadly.  "If I say no he will only want me to dine at
Rutland Gate, and that would be worse still.  The
last time I went I was put next to a woman who ate
nothing but beans and drank hot water and lemon.
It made me feel quite faint."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Guy.  "I will tell him to come
along at eight.  Don't go out and forget all about it."
</p>

<p>
He made another stiff little bow to Isabel, and
walking across to the door, took his departure.
</p>

<p>
"That's Guy," said Tony.  "What do you
think of him?"
</p>

<p>
"I think he's rather nice," said Isabel thoughtfully.
"He is just a wee bit serious, of course, but
then you want that in a secretary, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "Guy is wonderful," he began.
"Since he came to live with me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was interrupted by the reappearance of Spalding,
who entered the room carrying a tray full of
silver dishes which sent up various appetizing odours
into the morning air.
</p>

<p>
Isabel contemplated the feast with frank interest.
</p>

<p>
"What a good breakfast!" she observed.  "Do
you always have a breakfast like this?"
</p>

<p>
"Always," replied Tony firmly.  "I find my
constitution requires it."
</p>

<p>
He walked across to the sideboard, where Spalding
had set out the dishes, and lifting up their covers in
turn announced the results to Isabel.
</p>

<p>
She selected mushroom omelette as a starting
point, and after helping himself lightly to the same
delicacy, Tony sat down alongside of her at the
gate-legged table.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, "and what's the report?  Has
Mrs. Spalding made you comfortable?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded gratefully.  "Yes," she said; "she
has been so pleasant and kind.  She didn't seem to
mind in the least my coming in like that in the middle
of the night, and this morning she had a cup of tea
and a lovely hot bath all ready for me when I woke
up."  She paused.  "I don't know what I should
have done last night if it hadn't been for you," she
added with a sudden slight return to her former
shyness.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you would have been all right," said Tony
cheerfully.  "Somebody else would have come along
and knocked those interfering gentlemen down for
you.  London is full of obliging strangers.  We just
had the good luck to be the first&mdash;that was all."
</p>

<p>
"It was not all," returned Isabel with spirit.
"There was the supper, and finding me somewhere to
go to, and asking me to breakfast this morning,
and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, being so nice about everything."  She
hesitated.  "Your friend&mdash;the one who fought for us
so bravely&mdash;I hope he was not hurt?"
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "You couldn't hurt Bugg,"
he said, "except with a pickaxe."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you told him how grateful I was to him,"
she added.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't had the chance yet," replied Tony.
"He hasn't come home."
</p>

<p>
A sudden look of concern flashed into Isabel's
amber eyes.  "Oh!" she exclaimed, "perhaps he is
hurt after all.  Perhaps he is in a hospital!"
</p>

<p>
"I should think it much more likely that he's in a
police station," observed Tony.  "I can't think why
he hasn't rung up though, unless it's because he is
anxious to keep my name out of it.  For a
prize-fighter Bugg has the most wonderfully delicate
feelings."
</p>

<p>
"A prize-fighter!" echoed Isabel.  "Is he a
prize-fighter like&mdash;like&mdash;like Carpentier?"
</p>

<p>
"Something like him," said Tony; "especially the
way he covers up."  He paused.  "Bugg is really
quite a famous person in his way you know.  He is
practically the welter-weight champion of England.
He only stays on here and works for me because it
amuses him.  I meant to explain last night, but there
were so many other things to talk about."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Isabel slowly.  "And you were just
walking together?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, as a matter of fact, Bugg had been boxing
at the Cosmopolitan Club.  It was over rather
earlier than we expected, and I was taking him along
to give him some supper.  That's how we happened
to be in Long Acre."
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded.  "I understand.  It is all plain
now.  Last night I was frightened and everything
seemed so confused."
</p>

<p>
"I don't wonder at it," said Tony sympathetically.
"Unless one's led a very strenuous life it must be
horribly confusing to be suddenly held up by a couple
of dagoes in Long Acre, and then rescued by a future
champion of England."
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I feel somehow that I ought to explain,"
began Isabel uncomfortably.  "You have been so
nice about not asking any questions, but of course
you must be wondering who I am, and&mdash;and how
things came to be like this."
</p>

<p>
"Only mildly and pleasantly," said Tony.  "I
never allow my curiosity to get painful."
</p>

<p>
Isabel set down her cup.  "I would tell you if I
could," she said rather desperately, "but there are
reasons why I mustn't."
</p>

<p>
Tony's face brightened at once.  "How nice!" he
observed.  "I love mystery, and so few people have
any of it about them nowadays&mdash;especially in
Hampstead."
</p>

<p>
"I hate it," exclaimed Isabel with what seemed
unnecessary bitterness: "I have had nothing else
but mystery and secrets all my life.  Oh, if you only
knew how lovely it was just to be oneself for once&mdash;to
be able to do and say exactly what one likes&mdash;"  She
paused and took a long, deep breath.  "I can't
go back again," she added.  "I&mdash;I believe I should
kill myself if I did."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you can't go back," said Tony.  "We
settled all that last night.  You are going to stay on
with Mrs. Spalding and adopt me and Guy as cousins.
I don't think there is any need to let Henry in
just at present.  One would want a bit of practice
before adopting Henry."
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked across at him with that frank, almost
childish smile of hers, which contrasted so delightfully
with the little touch of dignity in her manner.
</p>

<p>
"I should love to have some nice relations," she
said.  "All mine are perfectly horrid."
</p>

<p>
"And all mine," observed Tony, "are horribly
perfect.  I don't know which is the more trying of
the two."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's pause, and then, as if a
sudden thought had struck her, Isabel reached across
to the adjoining chair, and unhooked the little silver
chain-bag which she had brought in with her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, "before I forget I wanted to ask
you if you would be so kind as to do something for
me.  I hate bothering you, but you see I don't know
any one else, and I'm so ignorant about this kind of
thing."  She took out a couple of rings and a brooch
and pushed them across the table.  "It's to sell
them," she added.  "I&mdash;I think they ought to be
worth something."
</p>

<p>
Tony picked up the brooch.  It was a beautiful
piece of work&mdash;a large single and absolutely flawless
emerald, delicately set in gold.  Without being an
expert in such matters he knew enough of precious
stones to realize that it was of considerable value.
</p>

<p>
"I should think this would do to begin with,"
he said, "unless you are going to be very extravagant.
It ought to bring in bread and butter for the rest of
your life-time."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's face lighted up.  "Will it really!" she
exclaimed.  "How lovely.  I never thought it would
be worth as much as that!"
</p>

<p>
Tony turned his attention to the rings, which in
their way were every bit as good as the brooch.  One
was the half-hoop of sapphires and diamonds which
he had noticed on the previous evening, the other
consisted of three very fine rubies, mounted in a
curious, old-fashioned setting that seemed to be of
Eastern origin.
</p>

<p>
He examined them both with much interest and
then handed them back to Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"You must keep them," he said.  "They are
much too beautiful to sell, and besides, there is no
need to sell them.  The brooch will bring you in
quite a lot of money, and you can always get credit
from the milkman as long as you wear rubies and
diamonds."
</p>

<p>
Isabel smiled, and slipping on the two rings held
them out for Tony's inspection.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad," she said happily.  "I should hate
to have sold them really.  You see they belonged&mdash;"  She
again came to an abrupt and rather confused
halt.  "They belonged to my great-grandmother,"
she finished weakly.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," said Tony in a perfectly grave voice.
"She must have had charming hands."
</p>

<p>
There was a light tap at the door, and after a
moment's delay the discreet figure of Spalding again
appeared on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"I beg pardon, Sir Antony," he observed, "but
Bugg has just returned.  I thought you might wish
to be informed."
</p>

<p>
Tony pushed back his chair.  "What has he
been doing with himself?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I fancy, sir," returned Spalding impassively,
"that he has been spending the night in the Bow
Street police station."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" exclaimed Isabel in a horrified voice.
</p>

<p>
"Really!" said Tony.  "How exciting!"  He
turned to Isabel.  "Shall we have him up?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Send him along, Spalding," continued Tony.
"He needn't trouble about making himself beautiful.
Tell him I should like to see him at once."
</p>

<p>
The butler withdrew, and a few moments later
Bugg appeared in the doorway.  He saluted Tony
with a cheerful grin, and then, as he caught sight of
Isabel, a sudden embarrassment seemed to descend
upon his spirit.  He coughed apologetically, lowered
his eyes, and shuffled slightly with one foot.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Bugg," said Tony.  "Come and
sit down."
</p>

<p>
Bugg advanced cautiously to the nearest chair and
seated himself on the extreme edge.
</p>

<p>
"Mornin', sir," he observed.  Then, throwing a
nervous glance at Isabel, he added hoarsely,
"Pleased to see yer, Miss."
</p>

<p>
"I am very pleased to see you," said Isabel a little
shyly.  "I want to thank you for what you did last
night.  I am so sorry they took you to prison."
</p>

<p>
Bugg stared hard at the carpet.  "That's all right,
Miss," he muttered.  "Don't you worry abaht that,
Miss."
</p>

<p>
Tony offered Isabel a cigarette, and then lit one
himself.
</p>

<p>
"You were magnificent, Bugg," he said.  "Tell us
what happened after we left."
</p>

<p>
Bugg coughed again.  "Well, sir, 'twas this wy,
sir.  Seein' as you and the young laidy was best
aht of it, I jest keeps them two Daigoes busy like
withaht puttin' 'em through it.  It didn't seem to me
as no one was goin' to taike the trouble to foller you
when 'e could be standin' there watchin' a scrap fur
nothin'."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you didn't get hurt," said Isabel, who, with
a slightly bewildered expression, had been trying to
follow this narrative.
</p>

<p>
Bugg shook his head.  "Not me, Miss.  It was
jest a 'alf 'oliday fur me till they starts usin' their
feet, and then I 'anded 'em a couple of flaps in the
jaw quick, an' that steadied 'em.  Not as I think they
meant no 'arm, Miss.  There's parts o' the world
where they don't know no better.
</p>

<p>
"Yours is a generous heart, Bugg," said Tony.
"What happened next?"
</p>

<p>
"The rozzers come then, sir&mdash;a pair of 'em, sir.
They busts in through the crowd like tigers, and
afore ye could wink, one of 'em grabs onter me, and
the other cops 'old of the tall Daigo."
</p>

<p>
"And the second man&mdash;the one with the crooked
eyes?" asked Isabel quickly.  "What happened to
him?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't rightly know, Miss," said Bugg
apologetically.  "Yer see, 'e weren't there in a
manner o' speakin'.  'E'd gorn across the street
when I give 'im that shove in the jaw, an 'e 'adn't
'ad time to come back.  I think the coppers missed
'im."
</p>

<p>
"But they stuck to you two all right?" said Tony.
</p>

<p>
Bugg nodded his head.  "Yus, sir, we all goes
orf to the staition together&mdash;me an' the cops an' the
Daigo an' the 'ole bloomin' street arter us.  It
weren't 'alf a picnic, sir, I can tell yer.  Well, w'en
we gets to the staition, I sees the inspector&mdash;'im wot
taikes the charge&mdash;lookin' partikler 'ard at me, but
'e don't say nothin', 'cept to ask me my naime and
address.
</p>

<p>
"''Erbert Johnson of 'Igh Street, Keington,' says
I.  It was the fust thing as comes into my 'ead.
</p>

<p>
"'An' you?' says 'e, turnin' to the Daigo.
</p>

<p>
"'My naime is Smith,' says the Daigo in 'is funny
foreign wy o' speakin'.
</p>

<p>
"'It's a good naime,' says the inspector, writin' it
dahn.  'Wot's all this trouble abaht?'
</p>

<p>
"'It was a misunderstandin',' says the Daigo
very 'aughty like.  'I declines to answer any further
questions.'
</p>

<p>
"'You got anything to sy, 'Erbert Johnson,'
says 'e to me.
</p>

<p>
"'I agree with the gen'leman wot's just spoke,
sir,' says I.
</p>

<p>
"'Very well,' says 'e.  'This is a matter fur 'is
Honour, this is.  You'll 'ave to stop 'ere the night,
the pair of ye, unless ye've got some kind friends
as'll come along an' bail yer aht.'
</p>

<p>
"'E looks at us both, but the Daigo don't sy nothin'
and I thinks to meself the more privit we keeps this
'ere little mixup the better fur all parties concerned.
So I lays low too, an' orf we goes to the cells, saime as
a couple o' ord'nary drunks and disorderlies."
</p>

<p>
Bugg paused for a moment, and a reminiscent
grin spread slowly across his face.
</p>

<p>
"It's a good story," said Tony encouragingly.
"Go on with it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I 'adn't bin in the cell very long w'en
the door opens and who should come in but the
inspector 'isself.  'E looks me up an' dahn with a
kinder twinkle in 'is eye, an' then 'e says, ''Erbert
Johnson,' 'e says, 'w'y the 'ell didn't yer dot 'im one
o' them left 'ooks o' yours, and then we shouldn't
'ave 'ad all this trouble?'  Well, that done it, sir!
I twigs at once 'e'd spotted who I was, and seein' 'e
meant ter be friendly like I ups and tells 'im just
exactly 'ow it 'ad all come abaht.  'Don't worry,'
says 'e ter me; 'your blue-chinned pal don't want a
fuss no more'n you do.  'E's jest bin bribin' and
corruptin' o' me to run the caise through as a
ord'nary street quarrel, an' seein' as we're told ter be
kind to straingers, per'aps I might see my wy ter
do it.'  Then 'e puts 'is 'and on my shoulder.  'As
fur you, 'Erbert Johnson,' 'e says, 'you gotter come
along with me an' be introjooced to some o' the boys.
We does a bit o' scrappin' 'ere in our spare time, an'
'tain't often we 'as the honour of entertaining a
future champion of England.'
</p>

<p>
"With that, sir, 'e taikes me upstairs to the
inspector's room, where there was 'alf a dozen cops
sittin' arahnd smokin' and drinkin' saime as if it was a
pub or a privit drorin' room.  Talk o' sports, sir&mdash;w'y
Gawd love us I might a bin the King of England
the wy they treated me.  'Tell us abaht the fight,
Tiger,' they says, and if you'd seen me sittin'
there, sir, with a large Bass in one 'and and a
four-penny stinker in the other and all them cops 'angin'
on my words, ye'd 'ave laughed fit ter bust yerself,
sir."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded his head.  "I have always suspected
that the police led a double life," he said.
</p>

<p>
"They're all right, sir," explained Bugg earnestly,
"on'y they got their livin' to get, saime as other folks.
They treated me proper, they did.  Gimme a 'addick
fur breakfast next mornin', and w'en the caise comes
on they 'as it all arrainged fur us right an' simple as
anything.  The copper as took us 'e tells 'is little bit,
saime as wot 'e'd fixed up with the inspector, an'
then the Beak&mdash;'ole Sir 'Orace Samuel it was&mdash;'e
puts on 'is glasses and blinks rahnd at the pair of us.
'Either o' the prisoners any observations to hoffer?'
'e says.  'E waits 'alf a tick, an' then as neither of us
says nothin', 'e scratches 'is 'ead and grunts aht,
'seven-and-sixpence an' costs, an' 'urry up with the
nex' caise.'"
</p>

<p>
Bugg stopped, and wiping his forehead with his
coat sleeve looked from Tony to Isabel and then back
again at his patron.
</p>

<p>
"An' that's abaht all, sir," he added.  "We forks
out the rhino, and then I gets a taxi-cab and tells the
bloke to bung along 'ere as quick as 'e can shift."  He
hesitated for a moment.  "I 'ope I done the right
thing, sir?" he finished anxiously.
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause.
</p>

<p>
"You always do the right thing, Bugg," said Tony,
at last.  "It's almost a disease with you."
</p>

<p>
He pushed back his chair and for a little while
remained gazing thoughtfully at the marmalade pot.
</p>

<p>
"Bugg," he said; "have you any special engagements
the next few days?"
</p>

<p>
"Not as I knows on, sir," replied Tiger, innocently.
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded his head.  "Good," he observed,
and without further comment he renewed his
contemplation of the breakfast table.
</p>

<p>
"There's the matter o' the stakes, sir," Bugg
ventured to remind him.  "'Alf-past twelve, sir, was the
time Dr. Donaldson said they'd be payin' over."
</p>

<p>
Tony again nodded.  "That will be all right,
Bugg," he said.  "I will go down to the Club myself
and collect the royal booty.  I only hope Da Freitas
will turn up personally.  It would give me great
pleasure to watch him writing out the cheque."
</p>

<p>
He looked across smilingly towards Isabel, and saw
to his amazement that she had suddenly gone as
white as a sheet.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
PRICING AN HEIRLOOM
</h3>

<p>
Tony was so surprised that for a moment he
remained just as he was.  Then suddenly recovering
himself he turned back to Bugg.
</p>

<p>
"You had better go along and find yourself something
to eat, 'Tiger,'" he said.  "That haddock must
be getting a little historical by now."
</p>

<p>
Bugg rose to his feet with a grin.  "I could shift a
bit, sir," he observed, "an' that ain't 'alf a fact."
</p>

<p>
"Tell the cook what you'd like," said Tony.
"After last night she will do anything for you."  He
paused.  "I want to see you again before I go out,"
he added.
</p>

<p>
Bugg touched his forehead, and after making a
respectful obeisance to Isabel withdrew from the
room.  Tony followed him to the door, and then
closing it after him, turned back leisurely towards the
table.  Though she still looked a little pale and
upset, the interval had obviously done Isabel good.
</p>

<p>
"Is there anything the matter?" asked Tony kindly.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, with a plucky if rather
unsuccessful attempt at a smile.  "No," she said, "I&mdash;I
didn't feel very well for a moment.  It's
nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing."  She paused, her lower lip
caught nervously between her small white teeth.
"I don't think I ought to bother you any more,"
she added with a kind of forced calmness.  "I
think perhaps it would be best after all if I&mdash;if I
found somewhere else to go to."
</p>

<p>
Tony made a gesture of dissent.  "It can't be
done," he said gravely.  "You see you are my
lodger now, and you have got to give me a full week's
notice."  Then with a sudden change he went on:
"You mustn't be selfish you know, Isabel.  You
can't float into people's lives out of Long Acre with
all sorts of delightful suggestions of romance and
mystery about you, and then simply disappear again
the next morning.  It's not playing the game.  I
should feel like a man who had been turned out of a
theatre at the end of the first act."
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand," said Isabel almost in a
whisper.
</p>

<p>
"I know I don't," said Tony cheerfully.  "That's
what's so charming about it."  He paused.  "Suppose
we have a week's trial at all events?" he suggested.
"If it turns out a failure it will be just as
easy for you to disappear then.  You know both
Guy and I improve on acquaintance&mdash;really.  You
mustn't judge us by what we are like at breakfast.
We get much more bright and pleasant as the day
wears on."
</p>

<p>
In spite of herself Isabel laughed.  "It isn't that I
don't want to stay," she said.  "I&mdash;I like you both
very much."  She hesitated and looked nervously
round the room as if seeking for inspiration.  "It's
what might happen," she added.  "I can't explain,
but I might be the cause of getting you into trouble
or&mdash;or even danger."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said Tony.  "I like danger,
and Guy simply adores trouble.  He takes it with
everything."
</p>

<p>
Isabel made a faint gesture of helplessness.  "Oh,"
she said.  "I can't go on arguing.  You are so
obstinate.  But I have warned you, haven't I?"
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "If you like to call it a warning," he
said.  "I look on it more as a promise.  If you knew
how dull Hampstead was you would understand our
morbid thirst for a little unhealthy excitement."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I should find Hampstead dull,"
remarked Isabel a shade wistfully.  "It seems to me
just beautifully peaceful.  I think I should like to
live here for ever, and do exactly what I want to, and
not be bothered about anything."
</p>

<p>
"But that's precisely what I am suggesting,"
observed Tony.
</p>

<p>
Isabel smiled again.  She seemed to be recovering
her spirits.  "I should have to get some clothes
first," she said.  "I couldn't live here for ever on
the contents of one small dressing-bag."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds inadequate," agreed Tony, "but I
think that's a difficulty we might get over.  I was
just going to propose that you should take the car
and Mrs. Spalding this afternoon, and go and do
some shopping."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's eyes sparkled.  "How lovely!" she
exclaimed.  Then a sudden cloud came over her face.
"But I forgot," she added, "I haven't any money&mdash;not
until you have sold the brooch for me."
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't matter," said Tony.  "If you will
let me, I will advance you fifty pounds, and you can
pay me to-morrow when we settle up."
</p>

<p>
Isabel took a deep breath.  "Oh, you are kind,"
she said.  Then for a moment she paused, her
forehead knitted as though some unpleasant thought had
suddenly come into her mind.
</p>

<p>
"Anything wrong?" inquired Tony.
</p>

<p>
She looked round again with the same half-nervous,
half-hunted expression he had seen before.
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking," she faltered.  "Those two
men.  I wonder if there is any chance that I might
meet them again.  I&mdash;I know it's silly to be frightened,
but somehow or other&mdash;"  She broke off as if
hardly knowing how to finish the sentence.
</p>

<p>
Tony leaned across the table and took her hand in
his.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Isabel," he said, "you have got to
forget those ridiculous people.  Whoever they are
it is quite impossible for them to interfere with you
again.  We don't allow our adopted cousin to be
frightened by anybody, let alone a couple of freaks
out of a comic opera.  I would have come shopping
with you myself this afternoon if I hadn't promised
to try out a new car at Brooklands.  As it is I am
going to send Bugg.  He will sit in front with
Jennings, and if you want any one knocked down you
have only to mention the fact and he will do it for
you at once."
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked across at him gratefully.  "It's just
like having a private army of one's own," she said.
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded approvingly.  "That's the idea
exactly.  We'll call ourselves the Isabel Defence
Force, and we'll make this our headquarters.  You
are really quite safe, you know, with Mrs. Spalding,
but you can always retreat here when you feel
specially nervous."  He patted her hand encouragingly,
and sat back in his chair.  "Why not stay
here now," he suggested, "until you go shopping?
No one will bother you.  You can sit in the garden
and read a book, or else go to sleep in the hammock.
Spalding will get you some lunch when you feel like it."
</p>

<p>
"Lunch!" echoed Isabel, opening her eyes.  "What,
after this?"  She made an eloquent little gesture
towards the sideboard.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said Tony.  "The Hampstead climate
is very deceptive.  One requires a great deal of
nourishment."
</p>

<p>
"Is the nourishment compulsory?" asked Isabel.
"If not I think I should like to stay."
</p>

<p>
"You shall do exactly what you please about
everything," said Tony.  "I believe in complete
freedom&mdash;at all events for the upper classes."
</p>

<p>
He got up, and crossing the room to an old oak
bureau in the corner, took out a cheque book from
the drawer and filled in a cheque for fifty pounds.
This he blotted and handed to Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Here's a piece of the brooch for you to go on
with," he said.  "Jennings will drive you to the bank
first, and after that he will take you wherever you
want to go.  Don't worry about keeping him waiting
or anything of that sort.  He is quite used to it,
and he always looks unhappy in any case."
</p>

<p>
Isabel daintily folded up the cheque and put it
away in her bag.  Underneath her obvious gratitude
there was a certain air of naturalness about the way
she accepted Tony's help that the latter found
immensely fascinating.  It reminded him somehow
of a child or a princess in a fairy story.
</p>

<p>
"I shall love going shopping again," she began
frankly.  "It will seem like&mdash;"  Once more she
paused, and then as if she had suddenly changed
her mind about what she intended to say, she added a
little confusedly: "Oughtn't I to let Mrs. Spalding
know that I want her to come with me this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "I think we can manage
that for you," he said.  "The house is full of strong,
idle men."  He got up from the desk.  "Come along
and let me introduce you to the library, and then you
can find yourself something to read."
</p>

<p>
He led the way across the hall, and as he opened
the door of the apartment in question Isabel gave
a little exclamation of surprise and pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but what a lovely lot of books!" she said.
"I should never have guessed you were so fond of
reading."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not," said Tony.  "I never read anything
except Swinburne and <i>The Autocar</i>.  Most of these
belonged to my grandfather.  Books were a kind of
secret vice with him.  He collected them all his life
and left them to me in his will because he was quite
sure they would never get any thumb-marks on
them."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed softly, and advancing to the nearest
case began to examine the titles.  Tony watched
her for a moment, and then strolling out into the
hall, made his way back to the morning-room, where
he pressed the electric bell.
</p>

<p>
"Spalding," he said, when that incomparable
retainer answered his summons, "I have invited Miss
Francis to make use of the house and garden as much
as she pleases.  When I am not in I shall be obliged
if you will see that she has everything she wants."
</p>

<p>
Spalding's face remained superbly impassive.
"Certainly, Sir Antony," he replied, with a slight
bow.
</p>

<p>
"And send Bugg here," added Tony.  "I want to
speak to him before I go out."
</p>

<p>
Spalding withdrew, and after a moment or two
had elapsed, "Tiger" appeared on the threshold
hastily swallowing a portion of his interrupted lunch.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry to disturb you, Bugg," said Tony, "but I
want you to do something for me, if you will."
</p>

<p>
"You on'y got to give it a naime, sir," observed
the Tiger with a final and successful gulp.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to go out in the car this afternoon,
as well as Jennings.  Miss Francis is going to do some
shopping, and it's just possible that the two gentlemen
who were annoying her last night might try
the same thing again."
</p>

<p>
Bugg's grey-green eyes opened in honest
amazement.  "Wot!" he exclaimed.  "Ain't they 'ad
enough yet?  W'y if I'd knowed that I'd 'ave laid
fur the tall one and give 'im another shove in the
jaw w'en 'e come outer Court this mornin'."  He
paused and took an indignant breath.  "Wot's
their gaime any way, sir&mdash;chaisin' a young lidy like
that?"
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "I don't know exactly,
Bugg," he said, "but whatever it is I mean to put a
stop to it.  It is our duty to encourage a high moral
standard amongst the inferior races."
</p>

<p>
"Cert'nly, sir," observed Bugg approvingly.  "I
always says with a German or a Daigo it's a caise of
'it 'im fust an' argue with 'im arterwards.  You
can't maike no mistake then, sir."
</p>

<p>
"It seems a good working principle," admitted
Tony.  "Still there are occasions in life when
strategy&mdash;you know what strategy is, Bugg?&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The other scratched his head.  "Somethin' like
gettin' a bloke to lead w'en 'e don't want to, sir," he
hazarded.
</p>

<p>
"You have the idea," said Tony.  "Well, as I
was about to observe, there are occasions in life when
strategy is invaluable.  I am inclined to think that
this is one of them."
</p>

<p>
Bugg eyed him with questioning interest.  "Meanin'
to sye, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Meaning to say," added Tony, "that I should
rather like to find out who these gentlemen are who
are worrying Miss Francis.  If we knew their names
we might be able to bring a little moral pressure to
bear on them.  Knocking people down in the street
is such an unchristian remedy&mdash;besides it gets one
into trouble with the police."
</p>

<p>
"Then I ain't to shove it across 'em?" remarked
Bugg in a slightly disappointed voice.
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "Not unless they insist on
it," he said.  "As a matter of fact I don't think there
is really much chance of your meeting them: it's
only that I shall feel more comfortable if I know you
are in the car."
</p>

<p>
Bugg nodded his comprehension.  "That's all
right, sir," he observed reassuringly.  "I'll bring the
young laidy back saife an' 'earty.  You leave it ter
me."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Bugg," said Tony.  "I shall now be
able to go round Brooklands with a light heart."
</p>

<p>
He strolled back to the library, where he found
Isabel kneeling upon the broad window-seat looking
into a book which she had taken down from a
neighbouring shelf.  She made a charming picture
with her copper-coloured hair gleaming in the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Isabel," he said.  "I wish I could see
you again before to-morrow, but I am afraid there
isn't much chance.  I can't very well ask you to
dinner because of Cousin Henry.  He would rush
away and tell all my relations and half the House
of Commons."
</p>

<p>
A gleam of dismay flashed into Isabel's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"The House of Commons!" she repeated.  "Is
your cousin a statesman then, a&mdash;a&mdash;diplomat?"
</p>

<p>
"He is under that curious impression," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
Isabel laid her hand quickly upon his sleeve.
"You mustn't let him know I am here.  Promise me,
won't you?  Promise you won't even say that you
have met me."
</p>

<p>
There was a frightened urgency in her demand that
rilled Tony with a fresh surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I promise," he said.  "I have no
intention of telling any one I have met you, and as for
telling about you to Henry&mdash;well, I should as soon
think of playing music to a bullock."  He glanced up
at the clock.  "I must be off," he added.  "I will
bring the car round to-morrow and we will have a
nice long run in the country.  In the meanwhile try
and remember that you've got absolutely nothing
to be frightened about.  You are as safe with us as
if you were a thousand pound note in the Bank of
England."
</p>

<p>
He gave her fingers an encouraging squeeze, and
then leaving her looking after him with grateful eyes,
he walked across the hall to the front door, where
Jennings was standing beside the big Peugot.
</p>

<p>
"Jennings," said Tony, getting into the driving-seat,
"I have arranged for you to take Miss Francis
shopping this afternoon in the Rolls-Royce.  Bugg
and Mrs. Spalding will be coming with you."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir," responded Jennings joylessly.
</p>

<p>
"You will take Miss Francis to my bank first: after
that she will give you her own instructions."  He
paused.  "It's just possible you may meet with a
little interference from a couple of foreign gentlemen.
In that event I shall be obliged if you will assist Bugg
in knocking them down."
</p>

<p>
Jennings' brow darkened.  "If any one comes
messin' around with my car," he observed bitterly,
"I'll take a spanner to 'em quick.  I don't hold with
this here fist fighting: it's foolishness to my mind."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please, Jennings," said Tony.  "As
the challenged party you will be fully entitled to
choose your own weapons."
</p>

<p>
He slipped in his second speed, and gliding off
down the drive emerged on to the Heath.  The main
road was thickly strewn with nursemaids, and
elderly gentlemen, who had apparently selected it as
a suitable spot from which to admire the famous
view, but avoiding them with some skill, Tony
reached the top of Haverstock Hill, and turned up to
the right in the direction of the Spaldings' house.
</p>

<p>
His ring at the bell was answered by Mrs. Spalding
herself&mdash;a respectable-looking woman of about forty.
She welcomed Tony with a slightly flustered air of
friendly deference.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Mrs. Spalding," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Sir Antony," she replied.  "Won't
you step inside, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "I mustn't wait now.  I
have got to be at the Club in twenty minutes.  I
only came round to thank you for your kindness to
Miss Francis.  She tells me you have looked after her
like a mother."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Spalding seemed pleased, if a trifle embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"I am very glad to have been of any service, Sir
Antony.  Not but what it's been a pleasure to do
anything I could for Miss Francis.  A very nice
young lady, sir&mdash;and a real one, too, if I'm any judge
of such matters."
</p>

<p>
"I think you're a first-class judge," said Tony,
"and I am glad you like her, because I want her to
stay on with you for a bit.  The fact of the matter
is&mdash;" he came a step nearer and his voice assumed
a pleasantly confidential tone&mdash;"Miss Francis is an
orphan, and she has been compelled to leave her
guardian because he drinks and treats her badly.
Besides he's a foreigner, and you know what most of
them are like."
</p>

<p>
"Not a German, sir!" exclaimed Mrs. Spalding
feelingly.
</p>

<p>
"No, it's not quite as bad as that," said Tony.
"Still he is a brute, and I have made up my mind to
keep her out of his hands until her aunt comes back
from America.  If you will help us, I think we ought
to be able to manage it all right."
</p>

<p>
The combined chivalry and candour of Tony's
attitude in the affair evidently appealed to
Mrs. Spalding's finer nature.
</p>

<p>
"I think you are acting very right, sir," she
replied warmly.  "A young lady like that didn't
ought to be left in charge of a foreigner&mdash;let alone
one who's given to the drink.  If I can be of any
assistance you can count on me, Sir Antony."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said Tony.  "Well, in the first place, if
you can manage it, I want you to go shopping with
her this afternoon in the car.  She has to buy some
clothes and things, and it isn't safe for her to be
about in the West End alone.  If she came across
her guardian he would be quite likely to try and get
her back by force."
</p>

<p>
"They're a desperate lot, some of them foreigners,
when they're baulked," observed Mrs. Spalding
seriously.
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "That's why I have arranged to
send Bugg with you.  There is not really much
chance of your meeting with any interference, but
just in case you did&mdash;well, you could leave him to
discuss the matter, and come along home."  He
paused.  "You won't let Miss Francis think I have
been talking about her private affairs&mdash;will you?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Spalding made a dignified protest.  "I
shouldn't dream of no such thing, Sir Antony.  I
quite understand as you've been speaking to me in
confidence."
</p>

<p>
Tony held out his hand, which, after a moment's
respectful hesitation, the worthy woman accepted.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am very much obliged to you, Mrs. Spalding,"
he said.  "You have helped me out of a
great difficulty."  He stepped up into the driving-seat
and took hold of the wheel.  "The car will be
coming round about half-past two," he added, "and
I expect Miss Francis will be in it."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Spalding curtseyed, and responding with a
polite bow over the side, Tony released his brake
and glided off down the hill.
</p>

<p>
He did not drive direct to the Club, for on
reaching Oxford Street he made a short detour through
Hanover Square, and pulled up outside Murdock and
Mason, the long established and highly respectable
firm of jewellers.  He was evidently known there, for
so sooner had he entered the shop than the senior
partner, Mr. Charles Mason, a portly, benevolent
old gentleman with a white beard, stepped forward to
greet him.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Sir Antony," he observed, smiling
pleasantly through his gold-rimmed spectacles;
"we haven't had the pleasure of seeing you for quite
a long time.  I trust you are keeping well?"
</p>

<p>
"I am very well indeed, thank you, Mr. Mason,"
said Tony.  "In fact I am not at all sure I am not
better than I deserve to be."  He put his hand in his
pocket and pulled out Isabel's brooch.  "I have
come to ask you if you will do me a kindness."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason beamed more affably than ever.
"Anything in my power, at any time, Sir Antony."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I should like you to tell me how much this
is worth.  I don't want to sell it: I just want to find
out its value."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason took the brooch, and adjusting his
spectacles bent over it with professional deliberation.
It was not long before he looked up again with a
mingled expression of interest and surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know whether you are aware of the fact,
Sir Antony," he remarked, "but you have a very
exceptional piece of old jewellery here.  The stone is
one of the finest emeralds I have ever seen, and as
for the setting&mdash;" he again peered curiously at the
delicate gold tracery&mdash;"well, I don't want to express
an opinion too hastily, but I am inclined to put it
down as ancient Moorish work of a remarkably
beautiful kind."  He paused.  "I trust that you
wouldn't consider it a liberty, Sir Antony, if I
inquire whether you could tell me anything of its
history."
</p>

<p>
"It belonged to my cousin's great-grandmother,"
said Tony placidly.  "That's all I know about it at
present."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," said Mr. Mason, "indeed!  It would be
of great interest to discover where it was obtained
from.  A stone of this quality, to say nothing of its
exceptionally rare setting, is almost bound to have
attracted attention.  I should not be surprised to
find it had figured in the collection of some very
eminent personage."
</p>

<p>
"What do you suppose it's worth?" asked Tony.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason hesitated for a moment.  "Apart from
any historical interest it may possess," he replied
slowly, "I should put its value at something between
five and seven thousand pounds."
</p>

<p>
"Really!" said Tony.  "I had no idea my cousin's
great-grandmother was so extravagant."  He picked
up the brooch.  "I wonder if you could find me a nice
strong case for it, Mr. Mason.  Somebody might run
into me at Brooklands this afternoon, and it would
be a pity to get it chipped."
</p>

<p>
The old jeweller accepted the treasure with almost
reverent care, and calling up one of his assistants
entrusted it to the latter's charge.  In a minute or
so the man returned with a neatly fastened and carefully
sealed little package, which Tony thrust into his
pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Well, good-bye, Mr. Mason," he said, "and
thank you so much.  If I find out anything more
about my cousin's great-grandmother I will let you
know."
</p>

<p>
Bowing and beaming, Mr. Mason led the way
to the door. "I should be most interested&mdash;most
interested, Sir Antony.  Such a remarkable piece of
work must certainly possess a history.  I shouldn't
be surprised if it had belonged to any one&mdash;any
one&mdash;from Royalty downwards."
</p>

<p>
Half-past twelve was just striking when Tony
came out of the shop.  The distance is not far from
Bond Street to Covent Garden, but as intimate
students of London are aware the route on occasions
is apt to be a trifle congested.  It was therefore
about ten minutes after the appointed time when
Tony pulled up outside the Cosmopolitan and
jumping down from the car made his way straight
through the hall to Donaldson's private sanctum,
where the ceremony of settling up was invariably
conducted.
</p>

<p>
The first person who met his eyes on entering the
room was the Marquis da Freitas.  Despite his rôle
as payer-out that distinguished statesman appeared
to be in the best of spirits, and was chatting away
to a small knot of members that included "Doggy"
Donaldson and Dick Fisher the referee.  In a corner
of the room, tastefully arrayed in a check suit and
lemon-coloured gloves, lounged the slightly
crestfallen figure of Mr. "Lightning" Lopez.
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry to have kept you all waiting," said
Tony.  "I haven't even the excuse of having to come
up from Richmond&mdash;like the Marquis."
</p>

<p>
Da Freitas, who was in the act of lighting a cigar,
waved aside the apology with a characteristic gesture.
"A few minutes' grace are always permissible, Sir
Antony, except where a lady is concerned.  As for
my own punctuality&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders
and showed his white teeth in an amiable smile&mdash;"Well,
I was staying at Claridge's last night, so I
had even less distance to come than you."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-116"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-116.jpg" alt="&quot;I am so sorry to have kept you waiting,&quot; said Tony.  &quot;I haven't even the excuse of having to come up from Richmond--like the Marquis.&quot; Da Freitas, who was in the act of lighting a cigar, waved aside the apology. &quot;A few minutes' grace are always permissible, Sir Antony, except where a lady is concerned.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;I am so sorry to have kept you waiting,&quot; said Tony.  
&quot;I haven't even the excuse of having to come up from 
Richmond&mdash;like the Marquis.&quot; Da Freitas, who was 
in the act of lighting a cigar, waved aside the apology. 
&quot;A few minutes' grace are always permissible, Sir Antony, 
except where a lady is concerned.&quot;
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.  "Well, as we are all
here," broke in the genial rumble of "Doggy"
Donaldson, "what d'ye say to gettin' to work?  No
good spinning out these little affairs&mdash;is it?"
</p>

<p>
This sentiment seeming to meet with general
approval, the company seated themselves round the
big table in the centre.  The proceedings did not
take long, for after Donaldson had written out a
cheque for the stakes and purse, and handed fifty
pounds, which represented the loser's end, to Lopez,
there remained nothing else to do except to settle
up private wagers.  Tony, who was occupying the
pleasant position of receiver-general, stuffed away
the spoils into his pocket, and then following the
time-honoured custom of the Club on such occasions,
sent out for a magnum of champagne.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry the King isn't with us," he observed to
Da Freitas.  "I should like to drink his health and
wish him better luck next time."
</p>

<p>
"We all should!" exclaimed "Doggy" filling up his
glass.  "Gentlemen, here's to our distinguished
fellow-member, King Pedro of Livadia, and may he
soon get his own back on those dirty skunks who gave
him the chuck."
</p>

<p>
A general chorus of "Hear, hear," "Bravo,"
greeted this elegant little ovation, for if Pedro
himself had failed to inspire any particular affection in
the Club, its members shared to the full that fine
reverence for the Royal Principle which is invariably
found amongst sportsmen, actors, licensed victuallers,
and elderly ladies in boarding-houses.
</p>

<p>
The Marquis da Freitas acknowledged the toast
with that easy and polished urbanity which
distinguished all his actions.
</p>

<p>
"I can assure you, gentlemen," he observed,
"that amongst the many agreeable experiences that
have lightened His Majesty's temporary exile there
is none that he will look back on with more pleasure
than his association with the Cosmopolitan Club.
It is His Majesty's earnest hope, and may I add
mine also, that in the happy and I trust not far
distant days when our at present afflicted country
has succeeded in ridding herself of traitors and
oppressors we shall have the opportunity of
returning some portion of that hospitality which has been
so generously lavished on us in England.  I can only
add that there will never be any visitors to Livadia
more welcome to us than our friends of the
Cosmopolitan Club."
</p>

<p>
A heartfelt outburst of applause greeted these
sentiments&mdash;the idea of being the personal guests of a
reigning sovereign distinctly appealing to the
members present.
</p>

<p>
"I hope he means it," whispered "Doggy"
Donaldson in Tony's ear.  "I'd like to see a bit of
bull fightin', and they tell me the Livadian gals&mdash;"  He
smacked his lips thoughtfully as though in
anticipation of what might be accomplished under
the ægis of a royal patron.
</p>

<p>
Having created this favourable impression the
Marquis da Freitas looked at his watch and
announced that he must be going.  Tony, who had
promised to lunch at Brooklands before the trial,
also rose to take his departure, and together they
passed out of the room and down the corridor.
</p>

<p>
As they reached the hall, the swing door that led
out into the street was suddenly pushed open and a
man in a frock coat and top hat strode into the Club.
He was a remarkable-looking gentleman&mdash;not unlike
an elderly and fashionably dressed edition of Don
Quixote.  A dyed imperial and carefully corseted
figure gave him at first sight the appearance of being
younger than he really was, but his age could not
have been far short of sixty.
</p>

<p>
The most striking thing about him, however, was
his obvious agitation.  His face was worried and
haggard, and his hands were switching nervously
like those of a man suffering from some
uncontrollable mental excitement.
</p>

<p>
He came straight across the hall towards the
porter's box, and then catching sight of Da Freitas
turned towards him with an involuntary interjection
of relief.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you <i>are</i> here," he exclaimed.  "Thank God I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused abruptly as he suddenly perceived Tony
in the background, and at the same instant the
Marquis stepped forward and laid a hand on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow," he said in that smooth, masterful
voice of his, "how good of you to look me up!
Come along in here and have a chat."
</p>

<p>
On the right of the hall was a small room specially
reserved for the entertainment of visitors, and before
the stranger could have uttered another syllable&mdash;even
if he had wished to, the Marquis had drawn
him across the threshold and closed the door behind
them.
</p>

<p>
For several seconds Tony remained where he was,
contemplating the spot where they had disappeared.
Then, with that pleasant, unhurried smile of his, he
pulled out his case, and slowly and thoughtfully
lighted himself a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"One might almost imagine," he observed, "that
Da Freitas didn't want to take me into his confidence."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
BUGG'S STRATEGY
</h3>

<p>
There was a knock outside.
</p>

<p>
"Come in," said Tony, who was arranging his tie
in front of the glass.
</p>

<p>
The door opened, and Guy Oliver walked into the
bedroom.  He was in evening dress, which if possible
made him look more sedate than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Guy!" said Tony; "I am afraid I am a
little late.  Is Cousin Henry fuming on the mat?"
</p>

<p>
Guy shook his head.  "He hasn't turned up yet:
it's only just gone half-past."  He seated himself
on the end of the bed.  "How did you get on at
Brooklands?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Tony stepped back from the glass and contemplated
his tie with some satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"I had quite a cheerful day," he replied.  "I
managed to squeeze eighty-six out of her, and
finished up by breaking the back-axle."
</p>

<p>
Guy nodded grimly.  "You will break your neck
some day," he observed, "and then I suppose you
will be satisfied."
</p>

<p>
"I doubt it," said Tony; "not if our present
theology is anything approaching accurate."  He
picked up a dinner-jacket from the bed and began
slowly to put it on.  "Besides," he added thoughtfully,
"I shouldn't like to die just yet.  I think I see
a chance of doing a little good in the world."
</p>

<p>
Guy looked at him suspiciously.  "Who was that
girl you had to breakfast with you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Guy!" said Tony, "you get more cynical
every day."  He crossed to the washstand, and taking
a carnation out of its glass proceeded to arrange
it in his button-hole.
</p>

<p>
"But who is she?" persisted Guy.
</p>

<p>
"She is my adopted cousin.  Her name is Isabel&mdash;Isabel
Francis.  I adopted her after breakfast this
morning."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.  Then in a faintly
ironical voice Guy observed: "Since she appears
to be a relation of mine also, perhaps you wouldn't
mind telling me where and when you met her."
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least," said Tony imperturbably.
"We met each other in Long Acre last night at about
a quarter to eleven."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" exclaimed Guy.
</p>

<p>
"Long Acre," repeated Tony.  "It's a popular
thoroughfare running out of Leicester Square."  He
watched his cousin's face for a moment with some
enjoyment, and then added: "If you would try to
look less like the recording angel I might tell you all
about it."
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said Guy.
</p>

<p>
Tony paused to light a cigarette, and then seated
himself on the bed.  "It was like this," he began.
"Bugg and I were coming down Long Acre after the
fight, when we saw Isabel being&mdash;being&mdash;what's
the word&mdash;'accosted' by a couple of gentlemen who
looked like dressed-up organ-grinders.  As an
Englishman and a baronet I thought it was my duty to
interfere.
</p>

<p>
"You would," said Guy with conviction.
</p>

<p>
"Leaving Bugg to knock down the two gentlemen,"
proceeded Tony tranquilly, "I took Isabel to
supper at Verrier's.  We had a very good supper.
There was&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind about the supper," interrupted
Guy.  "How did she come to be having breakfast
with you this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"What a dreadfully direct mind you have," complained
Tony.  "There is no pleasure in telling you
a story."  He paused.  "The fact was," he added,
"that Isabel had nowhere to sleep, so I brought her
back to Mrs. Spalding's."
</p>

<p>
"You what?" demanded Guy.
</p>

<p>
"I brought her back to Mrs. Spalding's.  I
couldn't very well bring her here: I knew it would
shock you.  That's the worst of having a thoughtful
nature like mine."
</p>

<p>
"I say, is all this true?" asked Guy.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is," said Tony.  "Perfectly true.  I
couldn't invent anything half so interesting."
</p>

<p>
"You mean to say that you picked up a girl in
Long Acre, and that you've actually brought her
back and&mdash;and established her at the Spaldings'!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Guy!" said Tony.  "Please don't
talk like that.  It reminds me of one of Hall Caine's
heroes."  He stopped to flick the ash off his cigarette.
"You've seen Isabel.  You surely don't think she is
an abandoned adventuress, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Guy.  "I never suggested it: at least
I never meant to.  She seemed quite a nice girl in her
way, but&mdash;but&mdash;well, who is she, and what on earth
is she doing wandering about London without any
friends?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Tony.  "I think she has run
away from somewhere and doesn't want to go back.
The only thing I am certain about is that she had a
very extravagant great-grandmother."
</p>

<p>
Guy got up from the bed.  "Well," he said, "I
have seen you do some fairly insane things in my time,
but this is about the limit.  Why the girl may be
anything or anybody."
</p>

<p>
"I know," interrupted Tony. "It's the uncertainty
that makes it so exciting."
</p>

<p>
"But think of the position you're putting yourself
in!  Suppose she has run away from school and her
parents were to trace her here, why there would be a
scandal that would ruin the family!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you think I ought to do?" asked
Tony.  "Turn her out again into the cold hard
world?"
</p>

<p>
Guy shrugged his shoulders.  "You must do
what you like," he said.  "I'm not going to accept
any responsibility.  I have given you my opinion,
and if you don't choose&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was interrupted by a knock at the door, followed
almost immediately by the appearance of Spalding,
who was carrying a note upon a small silver tray.
He crossed the room and proffered the letter to
Tony.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Conway has just arrived, Sir Antony," he
remarked.  "He is in the drawing-room."
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" asked Tony, picking up the note.
</p>

<p>
"I believe it is a communication from Bugg, Sir
Antony.  Mrs. Spalding brought it round."
</p>

<p>
Tony turned to his cousin.  "You might go down
and kiss Henry, will you, Guy?" he said.  "I will be
with you in a second."
</p>

<p>
Guy left the room, and tearing open the envelope,
Tony took out the letter inside.  It was written in a
sprawling, illiterate hand, and beautifully innocent
of either stops or capitals.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
sir i and the young lady come home safe but i spotted
one of them forin blokes hanging round the corner of
the street so i says to meself I'd better stop here till i
heres from you becos i think he may be after the young
lady and Mrs S. says its all rite and i can sleep in the
kitchin and hoping i done rite your obedient servent tiger
bugg the young lady didnt spot the bloke.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Tony read this interesting missive through with
extreme care and then looked up at the expressionless
face of Spalding.
</p>

<p>
"For various reasons," he said, "it would be very
convenient if Bugg could sleep at your house for
the next day or so.  I suppose you would have no
objection if your wife approved?"
</p>

<p>
"None at all, Sir Antony," replied Spalding.  "I
make it a point never to object to anything of which
Mrs. Spalding approves."
</p>

<p>
Tony regarded him thoughtfully.  "I should
imagine you were a most considerate husband,
Spalding," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Spalding.  "My wife sees to that, sir."
</p>

<p>
Folding up the note and putting it in his pocket,
Tony made his way downstairs to the drawing-room,
where he found Guy in conversation with a heavily-built,
pink-faced, stolid-looking man of about forty
years of age.  This was Henry Conway, a first
cousin of both Tony and Guy, and an intensely
serious and painstaking member of the House of
Commons.  He had married Lady Laura Crampton,
the plain but public-spirited daughter of the Earl of
Kent&mdash;an alliance which had been of considerable
assistance to them both in their disinterested efforts
in behalf of the general welfare.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Henry," said Tony, coming forward with
a well-assumed air of pleasure.  "I am so sorry to be
late.  How's Laura?"
</p>

<p>
Henry shook hands.
</p>

<p>
"Laura is fairly well, thank you, Tony," he replied.
"I think she's a little overtaxed her strength
in working up this new league for closing the
public-houses to women, but no doubt she will soon be
herself again.  Her recuperative powers are wonderful,
quite wonderful."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Tony.  "I suppose the feeling
that one is promoting the happiness of one's
fellow-creatures acts as a sort of stimulus."
</p>

<p>
Henry nodded, and taking out his handkerchief
blew his nose resonantly.  "If it were not for that,"
he observed, "the strain of public life would at times
be almost intolerable."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause, broken by the opportune
appearance of Spalding with the announcement that
dinner was ready.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the meal the conversation remained
fairly general.  Henry was rich in that type of
intelligence which enables its possessor to discourse
copiously and decisively upon every possible topic
without puzzling the listener by introducing subtle or
original views.  Politics in some shape or other were
of course his principal theme, and in view of Guy's
warning, Tony expected every moment that the
menacing question of Balham North would obtrude
itself above the horizon.  Apparently, however, in
Henry's opinion, the presence of Spalding acted as a
barrier, and it was not until dinner was finished and
they were sitting alone over their coffee and cigars
that he began to approach the subject which was
really the cause of his visit.
</p>

<p>
"I understand," he said turning to Tony, "that
Guy has more or less acquainted you with the steps
that I have been taking in your interest."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "It's exceedingly kind of you,
Henry," he said.  "The only thing is I haven't
quite made up my mind yet whether I have the
necessary qualifications for a successful statesman."
</p>

<p>
Henry's eyebrows contracted.  "I was under the
impression," he said, "that we had already settled
that part of the affair."
</p>

<p>
"You and Laura may have settled it," replied
Tony.  "In important matters of this sort I always
prefer a little time for reflection."
</p>

<p>
Henry pushed back his chair from the table.
"And may I inquire," he asked with an obvious
attempt at irony, "what you would consider 'a
little time'?  It seems to me that six years ought to
be a sufficient period in which to decide what
one intends to do with one's self."  He paused.
"Unless, of course, you prefer to go on doing
nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing!" echoed Tony reprovingly.  "My dear
Henry!  What a way in which to describe my
multifarious activities."
</p>

<p>
With the stern self-control engendered by a public
career Henry managed to keep his temper.  "I am
speaking of useful and serious work in the world,"
he replied.  "You did your duty in the war certainly,
but since then you seem to have devoted your
life entirely to frivolous amusements."
</p>

<p>
"There is precious little frivolity about motor-racing,"
objected Tony.  "You should have been
with me to-day when the back-axle went."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Henry stiffly.  "I have something
better to do with my time."  He looked across
at Guy.  "I think you agree with me that the
manner in which Tony is wasting his life is nothing
short of deplorable."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I do," said Guy.  "I was telling him
so at dinner last night."
</p>

<p>
Henry nodded.  "The whole family are of the
same opinion."  He turned back to Tony.  "It
isn't as if you were a private individual and able to
do what you please.  A great position has its
obligations as well as its privileges.  The Conways
have always played an important part in public life,
and as head of the family it is your duty to see that
this tradition is maintained."
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at him with a certain amount of
admiration.  "If I only had your gifts, Henry," he
said, "I shouldn't hesitate a moment, but I don't
believe I could ever learn to talk as you do."
</p>

<p>
Henry acknowledged the compliment with a
pleased if slightly patronizing smile.  "Oh, I don't
know," he observed more graciously.  "I believe
you have considerable ability if you chose to exercise
it.  Of course one can't expect to become a finished
speaker all in a moment, but it's wonderful what a
little practice and experience will do.  Besides you
would have the benefit of my advice and assistance
from the start."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure I should," said Tony, "and Laura's,
too, I expect."
</p>

<p>
Henry nodded.  "No one is more interested in
your future than Laura is.  It was her original idea
that I should bring your name forward for Balham
North.  You can count on having her by your side
through the whole campaign."
</p>

<p>
"It's my belief," interrupted Guy a little hastily,
"that Tony would thoroughly enjoy an election.
The element of fighting about it ought to suit him
exactly."
</p>

<p>
"I wish it was some other place than Balham
North though," observed Tony pensively.  "I can't
see myself saying 'Men of Balham!' with just the
proper ring that the phrase ought to have."
</p>

<p>
Henry looked at him a shade mistrustfully.  "I
only hope," he replied, "that you intend to approach
the matter in a serious spirit.  I have gone out of my
way to put your name forward, and it might do me a
great deal of harm politically, if you choose to make a
deliberate fiasco of it."
</p>

<p>
With a reassuring smile, Tony pushed the port
towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you worry, Henry," he said.  "When I
take a thing up I always carry it through decently
and properly, don't I, Guy?"
</p>

<p>
"You carry it through, certainly," admitted the
latter.
</p>

<p>
"Then I understand," said Henry refilling his
glass, "that I can inform Headquarters you are
prepared to contest the seat at the next election."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so," said Tony.  "If it will really
give the family so much pleasure I haven't the heart
to refuse.  I am afraid it will mean a lot of extra work
for Guy, though."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't mind about me," put in Guy
unsympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"And how does one start?" asked Tony.  "I
have read somewhere about people nursing a
constituency.  Do we have to go down and nurse
Balham?"
</p>

<p>
Henry shook his head.  "There is no hurry," he
said.  "Sir George Wilmer has given us a private
hint that he means to retire at the next election, but
he is not going to make his intention public until
Christmas.  Properly used, this time will be
invaluable to you."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded thoughtfully.  "Yes," he said.  "I
shall enjoy a last run round before becoming an M.P.
One has got to be so devilish careful what one does
then."
</p>

<p>
"I was referring rather," said Henry with some
coldness, "to the opportunity it will afford you of
preparing yourself for your new position.  If you
choose to work hard you might by that time have
put yourself in the way of becoming a useful and
desirable acquisition to the House."
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," said Tony.  "I never thought
of looking at it like that."  He paused.  "What
would you advise me to work at?"
</p>

<p>
"If I were you," said Henry, "I should take up
some special subject&mdash;it doesn't much matter what
it is&mdash;foreign affairs, temperance, agriculture&mdash;anything
which is frequently before the House.  Make
yourself more or less of an authority on that, and then
you will have a recognized position from the very
start."  He stopped to consult his watch.  "I am
afraid I shall have to be going," he added.  "I have
promised to look in and say a few words to the West
Hampstead Anti-Vivisection League, who are holding
their annual meeting to-night, and it's getting on for
ten o'clock now."  He got up and held out a large,
white, soft hand, which Tony accepted with a certain
physical reluctance that hands of that sort always
inspired in him.
</p>

<p>
"I am pleased&mdash;very pleased," continued Henry,
"that you are at last beginning to realize the
responsibilities of your position.  When the time comes
you may rest assured that Laura and I will give you
any assistance in our power.  In the meantime, if
you want any advice about what to read or study,
you can't do better than to talk it over with Guy."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded again.  "I expect we shall have lots
of interesting chats together," he said.
</p>

<p>
He rang the bell for Henry's car, and accompanying
his cousin into the hall, helped him on with his
coat.  They stood talking in the doorway until a
well-appointed Daimler brougham rolled up noiselessly
to the porch, and then with another handshake
and a final good-night Tony returned to the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
He sat down heavily in his lately vacated chair.
"If you have any real love for me, Guy," he said,
"you will pass me the brandy."
</p>

<p>
Guy handed across a delicately shaped old Venetian
decanter, out of which Tony helped himself in
generous fashion.
</p>

<p>
"If I had an inn," he observed, "I should pay
Henry to sit in the bar parlour and talk about
politics.  I am sure he would drive the customers to
drink."
</p>

<p>
In spite of himself Guy smiled.  "I think you are
very unfair and very ungrateful," he replied serenely.
"Henry may be a little pompous at times, but after
all he means well, and he has your best interests at
heart."
</p>

<p>
Tony lit himself another cigar.  "All my relations
have," he said, "and the worst of it is, it's
such a horribly infectious complaint.  If I am
not uncommonly careful I shall be catching it
myself."
</p>

<p>
"You have managed to resist it pretty successfully
so far," observed Guy drily.
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Tony, "but that doesn't make
me feel really safe.  There is a sort of natural
tendency to take one's self seriously in the Conway
blood, and you can never be certain it won't suddenly
come bursting out.  I shouldn't be in the least
surprised if I finished up by getting the Victorian
Order, and the freedom of Manchester."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you do really mean to stand?" said
Guy after a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so," replied Tony.  "I think I would
agree to do anything rather than argue with
Henry."
</p>

<p>
He pushed back his chair and finishing off the
brandy in his glass, rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Going out?" asked Guy.
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "Just for a few minutes.  It's a
very important step in one's life to become a
member of Parliament&mdash;especially for Balham North.  I
am going to have a little quiet meditation beneath
the stars."
</p>

<p>
Guy looked at him disbelievingly.  "Umph!" he
observed, and taking out his favourite after-dinner
smoke&mdash;a short, well-seasoned briar pipe, began
methodically to fill it from his pouch.
</p>

<p>
Leaving him to this innocent luxury, Tony crossed
the hall, and without troubling to pick up a hat
sauntered leisurely out of the house and down the
drive.  It was a perfect night.  Under a sky of inky
blue, powdered with stars, the Heath lay dark and
silent, as if dreaming regretfully of those far gone
spacious times when the mounted highwaymen lurked
amongst its bushes.
</p>

<p>
The only people who lurked there at present were
much too occupied with each other to pay any
attention to Tony.  With his cigar glowing pleasantly in
the darkness he strolled slowly across the grass in the
direction of the water-works, which stood up in a
clear-cut, black mass against the clearness of the
night sky.
</p>

<p>
A few yards further brought him to the end of the
quiet road in which the Spaldings' house was
situated.  It was overshadowed by trees, but in the
light of a street lamp some little way down, he
caught sight of a solitary, bare-headed figure leaning
over one of the front gates.  Even at that distance
he could recognize the familiar features of "Tiger"
Bugg.
</p>

<p>
As Tony came up, the future world's champion
lifted the latch, and stepped out noiselessly on to the
pavement to meet him.
</p>

<p>
"I guessed it was you, sir," he observed in a low
voice.  "You didn't 'appen to spot no one 'angin'
abaht under them trees as you come along?"
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head, and seated himself on the
low wall with his back to the railings.  "No, Bugg,"
he said.  "The road seemed to me distinctly empty."
</p>

<p>
Under the lamp-light, "Tiger's" face assumed an
expression of disappointment.  "Ah!" he remarked,
"I reckon they've spotted I'm layin' for 'em arter
all."  He paused.  "You got my letter, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, thank you, Bugg," said Tony.  "I want you
to tell me all about it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know as there's very much to tell, sir,"
responded Bugg modestly.  "It was like this 'ere, sir.
The young laidy done 'er shopping nice and comf'table,
and there 'adn't bin no sign of any one 'anging
arahnd or wantin' to maike trouble.  We wos comin'
back in the car and I was just thinkin' to meself as
things was all right, w'en Jennings swung 'er a bit
lively rahnd that bottom corner there,"&mdash;he jerked
his thumb away down the road&mdash;"and all of a sudden
I seed a 'ead dodgin' back be'ind one o' them big
trees.  'E was quick, but 'e weren't quite quick
enough for me.  I knew 'is dirty faice the moment I
set me eyes on it.  It was the other Daigo&mdash;the one
that copped a shove in the jaw last night and done
a buck w'en the rozzers come."
</p>

<p>
"You don't think Miss Francis saw him?" interrupted Tony.
</p>

<p>
Bugg shook his head.  "No one seen 'im except
me, sir; and I didn't say nothin', not bein' wishful to
frighten the young laidy.  Besides, it come into me
'ead wot you'd said abaht leadin' 'em on like, so I
jest sits w'ere I was till we reaches the 'ouse, an'
then I gets out an' goes inside saime as if I 'adn't
seen nothing.  I 'ope I done right, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Sherlock Holmes couldn't have done righter,"
observed Tony.  "I wonder how the devil they've
found out the house though."
</p>

<p>
Bugg scratched his ear.  "Well, sir, I bin thinkin 'it
over like, sir, and I reckon they must ha' followed me
this mornin', w'en I come up from the Court."
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at him admiringly.  "Bugg," he
said, "you are growing positively brilliant.  I have
no doubt that's the correct explanation.  They
were probably hanging about outside Goodman's Rest
and saw Miss Francis come back here in the car."  He
paused and took a thoughtful draw at his cigar.
"I suppose they're waiting for a chance to get her
alone again."
</p>

<p>
Bugg nodded.  "That's abaht it, sir; and that's
w'y I thought I'd best stop on 'ere.  I see
Mrs. Spalding knew something o' wot was up, so I gives 'er
the orfice straight abaht 'avin' spotted the bloke
be'ind the tree, and she suggests as I should write to
you an' she'll taike the letter rahnd."  He cleared
his throat, and expectorated in the gutter.  "And
that's 'ow things are, sir, in a manner o' speaking."
</p>

<p>
Tony knocked the ash off his cigar and got up from
his seat.
</p>

<p>
"I am vastly obliged to you, Bugg," he said.
"You are an ideal secretary for a knight errant."  He
looked up at the house, the windows of which
were in darkness.  "Have they gone to bed?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"I think the young laidy's turned in, sir," replied
Bugg.  "I reckon she was tired buyin' all them 'ats
and things.  Mrs. Spalding's abaht, if ye'd like to see
'er, sir."
</p>

<p>
He opened the gate for Tony, and they walked up
the narrow cobbled path which led to the house.
The front door was ajar, and just as they entered
Mrs. Spalding appeared in the passage, with a can of
hot water in her hand.  She put it down on seeing
Tony, and with her usual air of slightly flustered
deference, opened the door of Isabel's sitting-room,
and invited him to "step inside."
</p>

<p>
"I am not going to keep you up, Mrs. Spalding,"
he said cheerfully.  "I only came round in answer
to Bugg's letter.  It struck me that you might
possibly be feeling a little nervous, and I shouldn't
like to think that you were being worried in any way
about my affairs."
</p>

<p>
His consideration evidently touched Mrs. Spalding
deeply.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please to put your mind at ease about that,
Sir Antony," she observed.  "As long as Bugg's on
the premises it doesn't frighten me if people choose
to hang about outside the house."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Tony, pursuing his advantage,
"if you would rather, I could probably arrange to
get rooms for Miss Francis somewhere else.  The
only thing is her guardian would most certainly find
out, and Heaven knows what might happen to her
then!"
</p>

<p>
The good woman made a gesture of protest.  "You
mustn't think of it, Sir Antony," she declared.  "I
wouldn't never forgive myself if that sweet young
lady was got back by them foreigners.  I've taken a
rare liking to her, Sir Antony, and it's an honour and
a pleasure to be of any assistance.  I was saying as
much to Spalding to-night, an' he agreed with me
every word."
</p>

<p>
Tony launched an inward blessing on Spalding's
philosophic theories about matrimonial happiness.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you both feel like that," he said, "I shall
go on taking advantage of your kindness.  It won't
be for long, because Miss Francis' aunt is bound to
be coming back soon.  In the meanwhile,"&mdash;he
turned to include Bugg, who, with his usual tact,
had remained modestly on the doorstep, "we will
soon put a stop to this spying business.  I am not
going to have dirty looking people popping in and out
behind trees anywhere near my house.  The rates
are much too high to put up with that sort of thing."  He
stopped to take another puff at his cigar, which he
had nearly allowed to go out.  "I suppose Miss
Francis has gone to bed?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Spalding nodded.  "It's what you might
call tiring work&mdash;shopping is, Sir Antony, especially
when a young lady's used to having most things done
for her, as I can see Miss Francis is."  She paused.
"I was just taking her up some hot water when you
came in," she added.
</p>

<p>
"Really," said Tony; "well, we mustn't keep it
waiting about or it will be losing its character."  He
turned towards the door.  "By the way," he added,
"you might tell Miss Francis that if she would care
for a motor drive to-morrow I should be delighted
to take her.  I daresay she will be coming round
in the morning and we can fix up the time then."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Spalding promised to deliver the message, and
wishing her good-night, Tony sauntered off down
the drive, with his hand on Bugg's shoulder.  They
came to a halt at the gate.
</p>

<p>
"It's an undignified position for the future
champion of England to be acting as a watch-dog, Bugg,"
he said, "but having put our hands to the plough&mdash;"  He
broke off and remained for a moment or two
thoughtfully contemplating the star-spangled stretch
of firmament which was visible between the trees.
</p>

<p>
With an expression of patient interest, Bugg
waited for him to continue.
</p>

<p>
"Let us summarize the situation, Bugg," he
said gravely.  "Then we shall know exactly where
we are."  He paused.  "For some reason, which I
don't understand any more than you do at present,
those two gentlemen we had the pleasure of introducing
ourselves to in Long Acre appear to be very
anxious to meet Miss Francis alone.  Well, she
doesn't want to be met, and considering their faces
I sympathize with her taste.  That's all we know,
and until we can find out something more there
doesn't seem very much to be done.  We must just
keep Miss Francis properly watched and guarded,
and see if we can pick up any information about our
pals outside."  He paused again.  "I think it's
just on the cards we might have a little quiet fun with
them before long, Bugg," he added pensively.
</p>

<p>
Bugg gave an appreciative grin and nodded his
head.  "You can leave the watchin' and guardin'
part to me, sir.  They won't get no talk with the
young laidy&mdash;not while she's in this 'ouse."
</p>

<p>
"I believe you, Bugg," said Tony, "and to-morrow
morning, when she comes to Goodman's Rest,
you might walk across the Heath with her."  He
opened the gate and stepped out on to the
pavement.  "Good-night," he added.  "I shall go back
to bed now.  To be really successful as a knight
errant one requires plenty of sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Bugg.  "Good-night, sir."
</p>

<p>
It was exactly a quarter to eleven by the big oak
clock in the hall when Tony re-entered his house.
He shut the front door behind him, and walking
across looked into the dining-room and study to see if
Guy were still up.  Both rooms were empty, and
he was just on the point of going upstairs when the
silence of the house was suddenly broken by the
sharp, aggressive ringing of a bell.
</p>

<p>
It came from the telephone which hung beside the
mantelpiece on the further side of the hall.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
AFFAIRS IN LIVADIA
</h3>

<p>
Tony retraced his steps and took down the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" came back a silvery answer.  "Is that
you, Tony?"
</p>

<p>
"It is.  Who's speaking?"
</p>

<p>
"It's me."
</p>

<p>
"Really!" said Tony.  "Which me?  I know
several with beautiful voices."
</p>

<p>
A little ripple of laughter floated down the wire.
"Don't be funny, Tony.  It's Molly&mdash;Molly Monk.
I want to see you."
</p>

<p>
"The longing is a mutual one," observed Tony.
"I was just going to bed, but it's a morbid custom.
Suppose I come along in the car instead and take you
out to supper?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd love it," answered Molly regretfully, "but
I'm afraid it can't be done.  I have promised to
go on and sing at one of Billy Higginson's evenings.
He is the only composer in London who can write a
tune."  She paused.  "What about to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow," said Tony, "is also a day."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am going out to lunch, but I do want to
see you if you could manage it.  Couldn't you run
over in the car and look me up some time in the
morning?  I'll give you a small bottle of champagne
if you will."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want any bribing," said Tony with
dignity.  "Is it good champagne?"
</p>

<p>
"Very good," said Molly.  "It's what I keep for
dramatic critics."
</p>

<p>
"I think I might be able to come then.  What is it
you want to see me about?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'll tell you to-morrow," came back the
answer.  "I really mustn't stop now because Daisy
Grey's waiting for me in her car.  Thanks so much.
It's awfully dear of you, Tony.  Good-night."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night," said Tony, and replacing the
receiver upon its hook, he resumed his interrupted
progress to bed.
</p>

<p>
It was just after half-past ten the next morning,
when Guy, while busily engaged in drawing up a
lease in his office, was interrupted by a knock at the
door.
</p>

<p>
"Come in," he called out, and in answer to his
summons, Tony, wearing a grey plush hat and
motoring gloves, sauntered into the room.  He looked
round with an air of leisurely interest.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Guy," he said.  "I like interrupting
you at this time.  I always feel I am throwing
you out for the entire day."
</p>

<p>
Guy laid down his pen.
</p>

<p>
"It's a harmless delusion," he observed, "and if it
gets you out of bed&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that didn't get me out of bed.  It was an
appointment I have to keep."  He walked across
to the fireplace and helped himself to a cigarette
from a box on the mantlepiece.  "Are you feeling
in a sympathetic mood this morning, Guy?"
</p>

<p>
The latter shook his head.  "Not particularly.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
Tony struck a match.  "Well, it's like this.  I
have invited our cousin Isabel to come round and see
me, and now I find myself unexpectedly compelled
to go out.  What's more I don't know how long it
will be before I get back."  He paused and looked
at Guy with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.  "Do
you think I can trust you to be kind and gentle with
her?"
</p>

<p>
Guy adjusted his pince-nez and looked across at
Tony with some sternness.
</p>

<p>
"I have already told you, Tony," he said, "that I
disapprove very strongly of this impossible escapade
of yours.  You don't know what trouble it may
lead you into.  For a man who wants to get into
Parliament any kind of scandal is absolutely
fatal."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want to go into Parliament," objected
Tony.  "I am doing it to oblige Henry, and
for the good of the nation.  As for this&mdash;what was
the beautiful word you used, Guy&mdash;'escapade'&mdash;you
surely wouldn't have me back out from motives of
funk?"
</p>

<p>
Guy shrugged his shoulders.  "You can please
yourself about it," he said, "but it's no good asking
me to help you.  As I've told you before, I decline
to mix myself up with it in any way."
</p>

<p>
"But you can't," persisted Tony; "at least not
without being horribly rude.  I have introduced you
to Isabel and she thinks you're charming.  She will
be sure to ask for you when she hears I am out."  He
paused.  "You wouldn't be a brute to her would
you, Guy?  You wouldn't throw her out of the house
or anything like that?"
</p>

<p>
Guy's lips tightened.  "I should certainly let her
see that I disapproved very strongly of the whole
episode," he said.  "Still you needn't worry about
that, because I have not the least intention of
meeting her."
</p>

<p>
He picked up his pen and began to resume his work.
</p>

<p>
"Yours is a very hard nature, Guy," said Tony
sadly.  "I think it's the result of never having known
a woman's love."
</p>

<p>
To this Guy did not condescend to answer, and
after looking at him for a moment with a grieved
expression, Tony sauntered downstairs to the front
door.
</p>

<p>
Outside stood the Hispano-Suiza&mdash;a long, slim,
venomous-looking white car&mdash;with Jennings in
attendance.  Tony stepped in and took possession of
the wheel.
</p>

<p>
"I shall probably be back in about an hour, Jennings,"
he said, "and very likely I shall be going
out again afterwards.  I don't know which car I
shall want, so you had better have them all ready."
</p>

<p>
Jennings touched his cap with the expression of a
resigned lemon ice, and pressing the electric starter
Tony glided off down the drive.
</p>

<p>
He reached Basil Mansions just on the stroke of
eleven.  Leaving the car in the courtyard he walked
across to Molly's flat, where the door was answered
by the beautiful French maid, who looked purer than
ever in the healthy morning sunshine.
</p>

<p>
As he entered the flat, Molly appeared in the hall.
She was wearing a loose garment of green silk,
caught together at the waist by a gold girdle.  As a
breakfast robe it erred perhaps on the side of the
fantastic, but it had the merit of showing off her red hair
to the best possible advantage.
</p>

<p>
"You nice old thing, Tony," she said.  "I know
you hate getting up early, too."
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind if there is anything to get up for,"
said Tony.  "It's the barrenness of the morning that
puts me off as a rule."
</p>

<p>
Molly slipped her bare arm through his, and led
him into the sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
"You shall open the champagne," she said.  "That
will give you an interest in life."
</p>

<p>
She brought him up to a little satin-wood table, on
which stood a silver tray, with some glasses and a
couple of small bottles of Heidsieek.  Tony looked at
the labels.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-150"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-150.jpg" alt="Tony looked at the labels. &quot;And do you mean to say,&quot; he remarked a little reproachfully, &quot;that you really waste this on dramatic critics?&quot; &quot;I give them the choice,&quot; said Molly gravely. &quot;They can either have that, or hold my hand.

<br />
Tony looked at the labels. &quot;And do you mean to say,&quot; 
he remarked a little reproachfully, &quot;that you really 
waste this on dramatic critics?&quot; &quot;I give them the 
choice,&quot; said Molly gravely. &quot;They can either have 
that, or hold my hand. So far, they have always chosen the champagne.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"And do you mean to say," he remarked a little
reproachfully, "that you really waste this on
dramatic critics?"
</p>

<p>
"I give them the choice," said Molly gravely.
"They can either have that, or hold my hand.  So
far they have always chosen the champagne."  She
crossed to the sofa and began arranging the cushions.
"Yank out the cork, Tony," she added, "and then
come and sit beside me.  I want you to give me some
of your very best advice."
</p>

<p>
Tony obeyed her instructions, and filling up the
two glasses, carried the tray across to where Molly
was reclining.  He set it down on the floor within
convenient reach, and then seated himself beside her
on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"What's the trouble?" he inquired sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
Molly lighted herself a cigarette, and thoughtfully
puffed out a little cloud of blue smoke.
</p>

<p>
"It's Peter," she said.  "Something has happened
to him; something serious."
</p>

<p>
"I know it has," said Tony.  "He had to pay me
five hundred of the best yesterday morning."
</p>

<p>
Molly shook her head.  "It's not that," she said.
"I know he hates being beaten at anything; but it
wouldn't upset him in the way I mean."  She
wriggled herself into a slightly more comfortable
position.  "I've got a notion it's something much
bigger," she added.
</p>

<p>
"Really!" said Tony with interest.  "What are
the symptoms?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he was coming to lunch here yesterday at a
quarter to two, and he rang up about one to say he
might be a little late.  I thought his voice sounded
a bit funny over the 'phone&mdash;you see I know Peter
pretty well by now&mdash;and when he rolled up I saw
there was something really serious the matter.  The
poor old dear was so worried and excited he could
hardly eat his lunch."
</p>

<p>
"Sounds bad," admitted Tony.  "Nothing but a
desperate crisis can put Royalty off their food."
</p>

<p>
Molly nodded.  "I know.  I thought for a moment
he might have fallen in love with somebody else, but
it wasn't that either.  Something's happened, and
unless I'm three parts of an idiot it's got to do with
Livadia."
</p>

<p>
"How exciting!" observed Tony.  "It makes me
feel like a secret service man in a novel."  He paused.
"Why do you think it's Livadia though?  It might&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If it wasn't Livadia," interrupted Molly, "he'd
have told me all about it."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you ask him?"
</p>

<p>
Molly shook her head.  "It's no good.  He has
promised Da Freitas never to talk about Livadian
affairs to anybody, and he's just sufficiently stupid to
keep his word even where I'm concerned.  Of course
I could get it out of him sooner or later, but you can't
rush Peter, and it's a question of time.  There's
something going on, and I want to find out what it is as
quick as possible."  She sat up and looked at Tony.
"That's where you come in," she added.
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at her in mild surprise.  "I would
love to help you if I could, Molly," he said, "but
I'm afraid that any lingering charm I may have had
for your Peter vanished with that five hundred quid
he had to fork out yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"You can help me all right if you will," said Molly.
She paused.  "Do you remember telling me once
about that friend of yours&mdash;what's his name?&mdash;the
boy who is running a motor business in Portriga?"
</p>

<p>
The dawn of an understanding began to flicker
across Tony's face.
</p>

<p>
"You mean Jimmy&mdash;Jimmy Dale."  He paused.
"If Jimmy can be of any use you have only got to
say so.  I am sure he will do anything I ask him short
of murdering the President."
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing as difficult as that," said Molly.
"I only want him to write me a letter."  She bent
forward and re-lit her cigarette from Tony's.  "You
see I want to know exactly what's happening out
in Livadia.  I am sure there's trouble on, or Peter
wouldn't be so upset, and a man actually living
in Portriga ought to be able to tell one something."
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy ought to," said Tony.  "He is by way of
being rather a pal of the President.  He sold him a
second-hand Rolls-Royce last year for a sort of state
coach, and the old boy was so pleased with his
bargain he quite took Jimmy up.  They seemed to be as
thick as thieves last time I had a letter&mdash;about
three months ago."  He paused to finish his
champagne.  "By the way," he added, "I don't believe
I have ever answered it."
</p>

<p>
"You never do answer letters," said Molly.
</p>

<p>
"That's why I always telephone."  She got up, and
walking across to a small satin-wood bureau, took out
a sheet of paper and an envelope.  "Be a darling
and answer it now," she went on.  "Then you can
ask what I want at the same time."
</p>

<p>
Tony rose in a leisurely manner from the sofa, and
coming up to where she was standing, seated himself
in the chair which she had placed in readiness.  Then
he picked up the pen and examined it with some
disapproval.
</p>

<p>
"I shall ink my fingers," he said.  "I always do
unless I have a Waterman."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Molly.  "It's in a good cause,
and I'll wash them for you afterwards."
</p>

<p>
Tony gazed thoughtfully at the paper, and then
placing his cigarette on the inkstand in front of him
bent over the desk and set about his task.  Molly
returned to the sofa, and for a few minutes except
for the scratching of the nib, and an occasional sigh
from the writer, a profound silence brooded over the
boudoir.
</p>

<p>
At last, with an air of some relief, Tony threw
down the pen, and turned round in his chair.
</p>

<p>
"How will this do?" he asked.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
MY DEAR JAMES:
</p>

<p>
I have been meaning to answer your last letter for
several months, but somehow or other I can never settle
down to serious work in the early spring.  I was very
pleased to hear that you are still alive, and mixing in such
good society.  I have never met any presidents myself,
but I always picture them as stout, elderly men with
bowler hats and red sashes round their waists.  If yours
isn't like this, don't tell me.  I hate to have my illusions
shattered.
</p>

<p>
I wish anyway that you would come back to London.
You were the only friend I ever had that I could be
certain of beating at billiards, and you have no right to
bury a talent like that in the wilds of Livadia.
</p>

<p>
If you will come soon you can do me a good turn.  I
am thinking of opening a garage in Piccadilly on
entirely new lines, and I want someone to manage it for
me.  The idea would be that customers could put up their
cars there, and when they came to fetch them they would
find their tools and gasoline absolutely untouched.  I
am sure it would be a terrific success just on account of its
novelty.  We would call it "The Sign of the Eighth
Commandment," and we should be able to charge fairly
high prices, because people would be so dazed at finding
they hadn't been robbed that they would never notice
what we were asking.  I am quite serious about this,
Jimmy, so come along back at once before the Livadians
further corrupt your natural dishonesty.
</p>

<p>
Talking of Livadia, there is something I want you to
do for me before you leave.  I have a young and beautiful
friend who takes a morbid interest in your local politics,
and she is extremely anxious to know exactly what is
happening out there at the present time.  I told her that
if there was any really promising villainy in the offing
you would be sure to know all about it, so don't destroy
the good impression of you I have taken the trouble to
give her.  Sit down and write me a nice, bright, chatty
letter telling me who is going to be murdered next and
when it's coming off, and then pack up your things, shake
the dust of Portriga off your boots (if you still wear boots)
and come home to
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Your friend and partner,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TONY.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"That's very nice," said Molly critically.  "I
had no idea you could write such a good letter."
</p>

<p>
"Nor had I," said Tony.  "I am always surprising
myself with my own talents."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"What's Jimmy like?" asked Molly.
</p>

<p>
Tony addressed the envelope and proceeded to
fasten it up.  "He is quite charming," he said.
"He is chubby and round, and he talks in a little
gentle whisper like a small child.  He can drink
fourteen whiskies without turning a hair, and I
don't believe he has ever lost his temper in his life."
</p>

<p>
"He sounds a dear," said Molly.  "I wonder you
let him go."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't help it," said Tony sadly.  "He has
some extraordinary objection to borrowing from his
friends, and he owed so much to everyone else that
he had to go away."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if he will answer the letter," said Molly.
</p>

<p>
Tony got up with the envelope in his hand.  "You
can be sure of that.  Jimmy always answers letters.
We shall hear from him in less than a week and I'll
come round and see you at once."  He looked at his
watch.  "I am afraid I must be off now, Molly.
I have a very important engagement with a bishop."
</p>

<p>
"Rot," returned Molly.  "Bishops never get up
till the middle of the day."
</p>

<p>
"This one does," said Tony.  "He suffers from
insomnia."
</p>

<p>
Molly laughed, and putting her hands on his
shoulders, stood up on tip-toe and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't tell him about that," she said, "or
he might be jealous."
</p>

<p>
It was exactly on the stroke of twelve as Tony's
car swung in again through the gate of Goodman's
Rest, and came to a standstill outside the front door.
</p>

<p>
Leaving it where it was, he walked into the hall
and rang the bell, which was answered almost
immediately by Spalding.
</p>

<p>
"Has Miss Francis arrived yet?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Spalding inclined his head.  "Yes, Sir Antony.
She is in the garden."  He paused.  "Mr. Oliver
is with her," he added.
</p>

<p>
Tony looked up in some surprise.  "Mr. Oliver!"
he repeated.  "What's he doing?"
</p>

<p>
"I heard him say he would show her the ranunculi,
sir," explained Spalding impassively.
</p>

<p>
Tony turned towards the study, the window of
which opened out on to the lawn.  The thought of
Isabel at the solitary mercy of Guy filled him with
sudden concern.  The latter had evidently changed
his mind about seeing her, and had doubtless taken
her into the garden to express the disapproval he had
so sternly enunciated that morning.
</p>

<p>
Reaching the French window, however, Tony came
to a sudden halt.  The sight that met his eyes was,
under the circumstances, a distinctly arresting one.
Half-way down the lawn was a small almond tree, its
slender branches just then a delicate tracery of pink
and white loveliness.  Guy and Isabel were standing
in front of this in an attitude which suggested
anything but the conclusion of a strained and painful
interview.  Isabel was looking up at the blossoms
with her lips parted in a smile of sheer delight.  A
few paces off, Guy was watching her with an expression
of earnest admiration almost as striking as that
which she was wasting upon the almond tree.
</p>

<p>
For perhaps a couple of seconds, Tony stood
motionless taking in the unexpected tableau.  Then
with a faint chuckle he pulled out his case and
thoughtfully lighted himself a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
As he did so, Guy stepped forward to the tree, and
breaking off a little cluster of blossom rather clumsily
offered it to Isabel.  She took the gift with a graceful
little gesture, like that of a princess accepting the
natural homage of a subject, and smiling her thanks
as Guy proceeded to fasten it in her dress.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Tony that this was a very favourable
moment for making his appearance.  He opened the
glass door, and walking down the steps, sauntered
quietly towards them across the lawn.
</p>

<p>
They both heard him at the same instant, and
turned quickly round.  Isabel gave a little
exclamation of pleased surprise, while Guy's face assumed
a sudden expression of embarrassment that filled
Tony with delight.  He looked at them gravely for
a moment, and then lifting up Isabel's hand lightly
kissed the pink tip of one of her fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Cousin Isabel," he said.  "I am
sorry to be late.  I hope Guy hasn't been unkind to
you."
</p>

<p>
"Unkind!" repeated Isabel, opening her eyes.
"Why he has been charming.  He has been showing
me the garden."  She looked across at Guy with that
frank, curiously attractive smile of hers.  "I don't
think we have quarrelled once, have we, Mr. Guy?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," said Guy with what seemed
unnecessary warmth.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad," observed Tony contentedly.  "It
always distresses me when relations can't get on
together."  He let go Isabel's hand and looked at his
watch.  "How do you feel about a run in the car?"
he inquired.  "It's just ten minutes past twelve now,
and we could get to Cookham comfortably for lunch
by one o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"I should love it," said Isabel gaily.  "I don't
know in the least where Cookham is, but it sounds a
splendid place to lunch at."
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at her with approval.  "I am glad
you like making bad puns, Isabel," he said.  "It's
a sure sign of a healthy and intelligent mind."
</p>

<p>
He led the way round to the front of the house,
where they found the Hispano-Suiza still decorating
the drive, with Jennings bending over the open
bonnet.  The chauffeur looked up and grudgingly
touched his cap as they approached.
</p>

<p>
"Came down to see if you would be wanting
either of the other cars," he observed.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think, Isabel?" inquired Tony.
"Will this do, or would you rather have something
more comfortable?"
</p>

<p>
She glanced with admiration over the tapering lines
of the slim racing body.  "Oh, let's have this one,"
she said.  "I love to go fast."
</p>

<p>
Guy gave a slight shudder.  "For goodness' sake
don't say that to Tony.  It's a direct encouragement
to suicide."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed cheerfully.  She seemed quite a
different person from the highly strung, frightened
girl whom Tony had rescued in Long Acre.
</p>

<p>
She buttoned her coat, and stepped lightly into the
seat alongside of Tony, who had already taken his
place at the wheel.
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of cold truth," he observed, "I am
a very careful driver.  If there's likely to be trouble
I never run any unnecessary risks, do I, Jennings?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't say, sir," replied Jennings sourly.  "I
always shuts me eyes."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed again and settling herself comfortably
back in the seat, waved her hand to Guy as the
car slid off down the drive.
</p>

<p>
Tony always drove well, but like most good
drivers he had his particular days.  This was
certainly one of them.  During the earlier part of
the journey, from Hampstead to Hammersmith,
his progress verged upon the miraculous.  The
Hispano glided in and out of the traffic like some slim
white premiere danseuse threading her way through
the mazes of a ballet, the applause of an audience
being supplied by the occasional compliments from
startled bus-drivers which floated after them through
the receding air.
</p>

<p>
Isabel seemed to enjoy it all immensely.  She
had evidently spoken the truth when she said she
was not nervous "in that way," for the most hair-breadth
escapes failed to disturb her serenity.  She
had the good sense not to talk much until they were
clear of the worst part of the traffic, but after that she
chatted away to Tony with practically no trace of
the embarrassment and shyness that she had
hitherto displayed.  Whatever her mysterious troubles
might be, she seemed for the time to have succeeded
in throwing them off her mind.
</p>

<p>
There being no particular hurry, and thinking
that Isabel would enjoy the drive, Tony did not take
the direct road for Maidenhead.  He crossed
Hammersmith Bridge and turned off into Richmond Park,
which just then was in all the fresh green beauty of its
new spring costume.
</p>

<p>
They were three-quarters of the way through and
were rapidly approaching the town, when quite
suddenly Isabel, who up till then had apparently
been taking little notice of where they were going,
broke off abruptly in the middle of what she was
saying.
</p>

<p>
"Why!" she stammered; "isn't&mdash;isn't this Richmond Park?"
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at her in mild surprise.  "Yes," he
said.  "I came round this way for the sake of the
run."  He paused.  "What's the matter?"  he added,
for all the colour and animation had died out of her
face.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I'd rather not go through Richmond," she
faltered, "if&mdash;if it's all the same to you."
</p>

<p>
Tony slackened down the pace to a mere crawl.
"Why of course," he said.  "We will do exactly
what you like.  I didn't know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The sentence was never finished.  With a sudden
little gasp Isabel shrank back in the car, cowering
against him almost as if she had been struck.
</p>

<p>
The cause of her alarm was not difficult to
discover.  A well-dressed elderly man who had been
walking slowly towards them with his head down, had
suddenly pulled up in the roadway and was staring
at her in a sort of incredulous amazement.  Although
Tony had only seen him once before, he recognized
him immediately.  It was the agitated gentleman
who had been talking to Da Freitas in the hall of the
Club on the previous morning.
</p>

<p>
For perhaps a second he remained planted in the
road apparently paralysed with amazement: then
with a sudden hoarse exclamation of "Isabella!" he
took a swift stride towards the car.
</p>

<p>
Isabel clutched Tony by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," she whispered faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, sir!" bellowed the stranger, and with
surprising agility for one of his age and dignified
appearance, he hopped upon the step and caught
hold of the door.
</p>

<p>
Tony didn't wait for any further instructions.
Freeing his arm quietly from Isabel he leaned across
the car, and with a sudden swift thrust in the chest
sent the intruder sprawling in the roadway.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment he jammed on the accelerator,
and the well-trained Hispano leaped forward
like a greyhound from its leash.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
A RUN-AWAY QUEEN
</h3>

<p>
A morbid regard for the exact speed limit was
never one of Tony's failings, and he covered the
short distance that separated them from the end of
the park in what was probably a record time for
that respectable stretch of fairway.
</p>

<p>
He slackened down a little on reaching the gates,
but as luck would have it there was no one about
to obstruct his progress, and in a graceful curve he
swept out on to the main road.
</p>

<p>
Then with a laugh he turned to Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I love going about with you, Isabel," he said.
"One never knows what's going to happen next."
</p>

<p>
She made no answer, but rising slightly in her
seat cast a quick, frightened glance over her shoulder
as if to see whether they were being followed.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite all right," went on Tony comfortingly.
"I don't know who your friend is, but we shan't be
seeing him again to-day."
</p>

<p>
"That," said Isabel faintly&mdash;"that was my uncle."
</p>

<p>
"Really!" said Tony.  "He seems very impulsive."
</p>

<p>
He paused for a moment while the Hispano neatly
negotiated a rather dazzled-looking cluster of
pedestrians, and then turning again to his companion he
added consolingly: "Don't let it worry you, Isabel.
Lots of charming people have eccentric uncles."
</p>

<p>
She made a little protesting gesture with her
hands.  "Oh, no, no," she said almost piteously,
"I can't go on like this.  I must tell you the whole
truth.  I ought to have done so right at the beginning."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you like," replied Tony, "but hadn't
we better wait till we have had some food.  It's
so much easier to tell the truth after a good meal."
</p>

<p>
She nodded rather forlornly, and without wasting
any further discussion on the matter, Tony turned
away to the right and headed off in the direction
of Cookham.  He continued to talk away to Isabel
in his easy, unruffled fashion exactly as if nothing
unusual had occurred, and by the end of the first
mile or so she had pulled herself together sufficiently
to answer him back with quite a passable imitation
of her former good spirits.  All the same it was
easy to see that underneath this apparent cheerfulness
she was in almost as nervous a state as when
he had first met her in Long Acre.
</p>

<p>
They reached Cookham, and slowing down as the
car entered its pleasant, straggling main street, Tony
turned into the courtyard of the Dragon.  A large,
sombre-looking dog attached to a chain greeted his
appearance with vociferous approval; a welcome
which, in spirit at all events, was handsomely
seconded by the smiling proprietress, who a moment
later made her appearance through the side
door.  Tony was distinctly popular at riverside
hotels.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, Miss Brown?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, thank you, Sir Antony," she replied.
"And you, sir?  Lie down."
</p>

<p>
The latter observation was addressed to the dog.
</p>

<p>
"I am suffering from hunger," observed Tony.
"Do you think you can make any nice suggestion
about lunch?"
</p>

<p>
The landlady paused reflectively.
</p>

<p>
"I can give you," she said, "some trout, a roast
duckling, and marrow on toast."
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at her for a moment in speechless
admiration.  "My dear Miss Brown," he
said, "that isn't a suggestion.  That's an outburst
of poetry."  He turned to Isabel apologetically.
"Roast duckling," he explained, "is one of the few
things that make me really excited."
</p>

<p>
She laughed&mdash;a little gay, frank, natural laugh
that Tony was delighted to hear.  "I think all
men are greedy," she said.  "At least all the men
I've ever known have been."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "It's one of the original instincts
of humanity," he observed thoughtfully.  "We
have to be greedy in self-defence.  A man who isn't
is bound to be beaten by a man who is.  It's what
Darwin calls the survival of the fattest."  He
turned back to the landlady who had been listening
to him with a placid smile.  "Send us a couple
of cocktails into the dining-room, will you, Miss
Brown," he said.  "It would be wicked to rush at a
lunch like that without any preparation."
</p>

<p>
All through the meal, which was served in a pleasant
room looking out into a quaint old courtyard
garden at the back, Tony kept the conversation in
the same strain of impersonal philosophy.  It was
not until the marrow on toast had gone the way
of all beautiful earthly things that he made any
reference to Isabel's promised revelation.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say to having coffee outside?" he
suggested.  "There's a nice place where we can sit
in the sun and you can tell me about your uncle.
One should never discuss one's relations in a public
dining-room."
</p>

<p>
Isabel contented herself with a nod, and after
giving their instructions to the waiter, they strolled
out through the open French window, and made
their way to a rustic bench at the farther end of the
garden.
</p>

<p>
It was a delightfully warm, peaceful spring
day, and the perfume of the hyacinths and daffodils
that were in full bloom almost overpowered
the slight odour of petrol from the neighbouring
garage.
</p>

<p>
"It's a curious coincidence," observed Tony, as
the waiter retired after placing their coffee on a
small table beside them, "but as a matter of fact I
feel in exactly the right frame of mind for listening
to the truth.  I expect it's that bottle of burgundy
we had."
</p>

<p>
He struck a match and held it out to Isabel, who,
bending forward, lighted the cigarette which she had
been twisting about between her fingers.
</p>

<p>
"It's&mdash;it's dreadfully difficult to tell things," she
said, sitting up and looking at him rather helplessly.
"I haven't the least notion how to begin."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it's difficult," said Tony.  "Nothing
requires so much practice as telling the truth.  It's
against every civilized impulse in human nature."
He paused.  "Suppose we try the catechism idea
for a start.  I ask you 'what is your name?' and
you say 'Isabel Francis.'"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "But&mdash;but it isn't," she
faltered.  "It's&mdash;it's Isabella, and there are about
eight other names after it."
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at her in surprise.  "Why that's
exactly the complaint I am suffering from.  I thought
it was peculiar to baronets and superfluous people of
that sort."
</p>

<p>
"Well, the fact is," began Isabel; then she stopped.
"Oh, I know it sounds too utterly silly," she went
on with a sort of hurried desperation, "but you see
the fact is I&mdash;I'm a queen."
</p>

<p>
She brought out the last three words as if she were
confessing some peculiarly shameful family secret.
</p>

<p>
Tony slowly removed his cigarette from his lips.
</p>

<p>
"A what?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Well, not exactly a queen," said Isabel, correcting
herself hastily.  "In a way I am, you know.  I
mean I ought to be.  At least that's what they say."  She
broke off in a charming confusion that made her
look prettier than ever.
</p>

<p>
Tony leaned back in the seat and contemplated her
with deep enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
"You grow more perfect every minute, Cousin
Isabel," he said.  "Don't hurry yourself, but just
tell me quite slowly and deliberately who you really
are."
</p>

<p>
Isabel took a long breath.  "My father was Don
Francisco of Livadia, and some people say I ought to
be the queen."
</p>

<p>
Tony was not easily surprised, but for once in his
life he sat up as if he had been struck by an
electric shock.  Even his trusty powers of speech were
temporarily numbed.
</p>

<p>
He had of course heard of Don Francisco&mdash;that
persistent gentleman who for twenty years had
indulged in spasmodic and ineffectual efforts to wrest
the throne of Livadia from Pedro's father.  But that
Isabel should be his daughter, and what was more
the apparently recognized heir to his royal claims,
was one of those staggering surprises for which the
English language contains no adequate comment.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he remained gazing at her in the
blankest astonishment; then the full humour of the
situation suddenly came home to him, and he broke
into a long chuckle of delighted amusement.
</p>

<p>
Isabel watched him sympathetically out of her
amber eyes.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite true," she said.  "I know it sounds
absurd, but it's quite true."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it's the least absurd," said Tony,
who had now completely recovered his normal
composure.  "I think it's the most beautifully reasonable
thing that's ever happened.  Of course you are a
queen, or ought to be a queen.  I felt that the
moment I met you."  He paused, and taking out his
case lighted himself a fresh cigarette.  "It was the
Livadian part of the business that knocked me out
so completely," he explained.
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded her head.  "I know," she said.  "I
heard you say that you knew Pedro and Da Freitas.
That was one of the things that made me feel I ought
to tell you."
</p>

<p>
"It only shows," remarked Tony with quiet
satisfaction, "that the Early Christian Fathers were
quite right.  If one has faith and patience one
generally gets what one wants sooner or later.  All
my life I have had a secret craving to be mixed up
in some really high-class conspiracy; with kings and
queens and bombs and wonderful mysterious people
crawling about trying to assassinate each other.  I
was just beginning to be afraid that all that kind of
thing was extinct."  He drew in a long mouthful of
smoke, and let it filter out luxuriously into the still,
warm air.  "How very fortunate I happened to be in
Long Acre, wasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad you feel like that," said Isabel
happily.  "I was afraid you wouldn't want to help
me any more when you knew all about it."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't know all about it yet," objected
Tony.  "Hadn't you better begin right at the
beginning and tell me everything?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment Isabel hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said slowly.  "I suppose that what
you would call the beginning&mdash;the real beginning&mdash;was
a long time before I was born.  You see my
grandfather always had an idea that he ought to be
king of Livadia, because he said there was something
wrong about somebody's marriage or something back
in sixteen hundred and fifty&mdash;at least I think that
was the date."
</p>

<p>
"It was a very careless century," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
"He didn't bother much about it himself," went on
Isabel, "because he hated Livadia and liked to live in
Paris or London.  Besides I think they made him an
allowance to keep out of the country.  Father was
quite different.  He always wanted to be a king,
and directly my grandfather died, he started doing
everything he could to get what he called 'his
rights.'"
</p>

<p>
"I can never understand any intelligent man
wanting to be a king," observed Tony thoughtfully.
"One would have to associate entirely with successful
people, and they are always so horribly busy and
conceited."
</p>

<p>
"But father wasn't intelligent," explained Isabel,
"not in the least little bit.  He was just obstinate.
He was quite certain he ought to be a king, and you
know when you are quite certain about a thing
yourself, however silly it is, there are always lots of
others who will agree with you."  She paused.
"Besides," she went on, "after the old King died and
Pedro's father came to the throne, things were quite
different in Livadia.  The taxes went on going up
and up, and the country kept on getting poorer and
poorer, until at last a certain number of people began
to wonder whether it wouldn't be better to have a
change.  I don't think they thought much of father.
I suppose they just felt he couldn't be worse anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"I like your historical sense, Isabel," observed
Tony.  "It's so free from prejudice."
</p>

<p>
Isabel accepted the compliment with perfect
simplicity.  "You see I knew father," she said
frankly.  "He would have made a very bad king;
he was always getting intoxicated."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "Nearly all exiled monarchs are
addicted to drink.  They find it necessary to keep up
their enthusiasm."
</p>

<p>
"But it wasn't only a question of drinking in
father's case," went on Isabel.  "People wouldn't
have minded that very much; you see they are so
used to it in Livadia.  It was the way he quarrelled
with everyone afterwards that spoilt his chances.
At one time he had almost as big a following as the
King, but after a bit most of them gave him up as
hopeless.  Then someone started the idea of a
Republic.  It was quite a small party at first, but
people drifted into it gradually from both sides until
in the end it was the strongest of the three.  Father
wouldn't give up for a long time.  He was a frightfully
obstinate man, and I don't think he knew what
it meant to be afraid.  That was one of his best
points.  He kept on until nearly everyone who stuck
to him had been killed, and then at last he got badly
wounded himself, and only just managed to escape
over the frontier."
</p>

<p>
"And what were you doing all this crowded time?"
inquired Tony.
</p>

<p>
"I," said Isabel, "oh, I was living in Paris with my
governess, Miss Watson."
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;the missing lady of Long Acre?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded.  "She looked after me for fifteen
years.  You see, father had spent a good deal of time
in London when he was young, and he always said
that English women were the only ones you could
trust because they were so cold.  So when my
mother died, he engaged Miss Watson and put me
in her charge altogether."
</p>

<p>
"Judging by the results," observed Tony, "it
seems to have been a happy choice."
</p>

<p>
"She's a dear," said Isabel with enthusiasm, "an
absolute dear.  I don't know what I should have
been like without her, because father always insisted
on his own people treating me as if I was a real
princess, and we never saw any one else.  If it hadn't
been for her, I should probably have believed
everything they told me."  She paused for a moment as
though reflecting on this narrow but fortunate escape,
and then straightening herself in the seat, she added:
"I was really quite happy until Uncle Philip sent her
away."
</p>

<p>
"Is Uncle Philip our impetuous friend of Richmond
Park?" inquired Tony.
</p>

<p>
"That's him," said Isabel, with a queenly
disregard for grammar.  "He is my mother's brother,
and his real name is the Count de Sé.  He came to
live with us in Paris after father was wounded.  He
is a nasty, mean, hateful sort of man, but father liked
him because he was the only person left who treated
him like a king.  Poor father was nearly always
drunk in those days, and I don't think he really
knew what he was doing.  Uncle Philip used to talk
to him and flatter him and all that sort of thing, and
at last he got father to make a will appointing him
as my guardian.  The very first thing he did, as
soon as father died, was to send away Miss Watson."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I like Uncle Philip," said Tony.
"I am glad I pushed him off the car."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," said Isabel with surprising viciousness.
"I only hope he hurt himself.  He did fall in the
road, didn't he?" she added anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"I think so," said Tony.  "It sounded like it anyway."
</p>

<p>
"I can't help feeling horrid about him," she went
on.  "It is all his fault that any of this has happened."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to hear something in his favour," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't mean my being here and knowing you.
I love that part of it.  I mean Richmond and Pedro
and Da Freitas, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, all the hateful,
ghastly time I have had the last month."
</p>

<p>
She broke off with a slight shiver, as though the
very memory were physically unpleasant.  Tony
smoked his cigarette in sympathetic silence until she
felt ready to continue.
</p>

<p>
"You see," she began, "after Miss Watson was
sent away there was no one to help me at all.  Uncle
Philip wouldn't let me have any money, and the
only person I could talk to was a horrible old
Frenchwoman who spied on me all the time like a cat.  I
had a year of that, and then one day Uncle Philip
told me that he had taken a house for us at Richmond
in England, and that we were going over to live there
at once.  I didn't mind.  Anything seemed better
than Paris, and of course I had no idea what his real
plans were."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"It didn't take me long to find out," she went on
bitterly.  "The day after we arrived, I was sitting in
the drawing-room when who should come in but
Uncle Philip and the Marquis da Freitas.  You can
imagine how astonished I was when Uncle introduced
him.  Of course I had always been brought up to
look on him as the worst enemy we had.  Well, he
bowed and he smiled and he paid me a lot of
compliments, and then he said that now Livadia was a
republic it was only right that the two branches of
the royal family should be friends.  He kept on
telling me how anxious King Pedro was to make my
acquaintance, and at last it came out that he and the
King were living in Richmond and that we were
invited over to dinner the next night.
</p>

<p>
"Even then," she continued slowly, "I didn't
guess what was behind it all.  It was only when he
was gone and I was alone with Uncle that I found
out the truth."
</p>

<p>
She paused.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" said Tony.
</p>

<p>
Isabel took another long breath.
</p>

<p>
"They had arranged for a marriage between me
and Pedro, and it was to come off in a couple of
months."
</p>

<p>
A low surprised whistle broke from Tony's lips.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" he said softly.  "By Jove!"
</p>

<p>
For a moment he remained contemplating Isabel
with a sort of grave enjoyment; then abandoning his
cigarette he sat up straight in the seat.
</p>

<p>
"This," he observed, "is undoubtedly a case of
predestination.  It must have been arranged millions
of years ago that I should be in Long Acre on that
particular evening."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it was," said Isabel.  "Anyway I
shouldn't have married Pedro whatever happened.  I
made up my mind about that the first time I saw
him."
</p>

<p>
"Did you tell him?" asked Tony.
</p>

<p>
"I told Uncle Philip as soon as we got home.  Of
course he was very angry, but I don't think he took
me seriously.  He just said it didn't make any
difference&mdash;that whether I liked it or not I should
have to be married, so I had better get used to the
idea as quickly as possible."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded his head thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"It all fits in perfectly except one thing," he said.
"I can't quite see what your uncle and Da Freitas
hope to get out of it.  They must both have some
notion at the back of their beautiful heads."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I don't understand," said Isabel in a
puzzled voice.  "Anyhow it's all their arrangement.
Pedro doesn't want to marry me really&mdash;not a little
bit.  He is only doing it because Da Freitas tells him
to."  She hesitated.  "If it hadn't been for that I
couldn't have stood it as long as I did."
</p>

<p>
"How long was it?" asked Tony sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"Just three weeks.  The day after that first dinner
Da Freitas came over again, and made a sort of
formal proposal.  I told him quite plainly I wouldn't,
but it didn't make any difference.  Uncle Philip
declared that I was shy, and didn't know what I
was talking about, and Da Freitas said in his horrid
oily way that he was quite sure when I got to know
Pedro better I would love him as much as he loved
me.  I saw it was no good saying anything else, so I
just made up my mind I would run away."
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at her approvingly.  "You are
extraordinarily practical," he said, "for the daughter
of an exiled monarch."
</p>

<p>
"There was nothing else to do," replied Isabel;
"but it wasn't easy.  You see I had no money
and Uncle never let me go out alone.  Wherever I
went I always had Suzanne the old Frenchwoman
with me.  The only person I could think of who
might be able to help me was Miss Watson.  When
she left she had given me her address in London, and
I knew she would do anything she could because she
hated Uncle Philip almost as much as I did.  I wrote
her a little note and carried it about with me in my
dress for days, but I never got a chance to post it.
Well, things went on like that till last Monday.  I
was feeling hateful, because Pedro had been to dinner
the night before, and I think he'd had too much to
drink.  Anyhow he had wanted to kiss me afterwards,
and there had been a frightful row, and everyone
had been perfectly horrid to me.  In the morning
Uncle started again.  He told me that he and the
Marquis da Freitas had decided to put a stop to
what he called my 'nonsense,' and that they were
making arrangements for me and Pedro to be
married immediately.  I felt miserable, but I wasn't
going to argue any more about it, so I just said
nothing.  He went over there about half-past six in
the evening and I was left alone in the house with
Suzanne.  They wouldn't trust me to be by myself
at all, except at night, when I was always locked in
my bedroom."
</p>

<p>
She stopped to push back a rebellious copper-coloured
curl which had temporarily escaped over
her forehead.
</p>

<p>
"We were sitting in the drawing-room," she went
on, "and Suzanne was knitting, and I was supposed
to be reading a book.  I wasn't really, because I was
too miserable to think about anything.  I was just
sitting doing nothing when I happened to look up,
and there I saw half-a-crown on the writing-desk
opposite.  I suppose it must have been Suzanne's.
Well, I looked at it for a moment, and then all of a
sudden I made up my mind.  I got up out of the
chair, and walked across the room as if I was going to
get something fresh to read.  As I passed the desk I
picked up the half-crown.  I had a horrible feeling
in my back that Suzanne was watching me, but I
didn't look round till I got to the book-case, and then
I saw that she was still knitting away quite peacefully
and happily.  I didn't wait any longer.  I just
walked straight on to the door, and before she knew
what was happening, I had slipped out on to the
landing and locked her in."
</p>

<p>
"Splendid!" said Tony with enthusiasm.  "I can
almost hear her gnashing her teeth."
</p>

<p>
"She was rather angry," admitted Isabel, "but I
didn't pay any attention to her.  I knew that no one
could hear, so I left her to shout and kick the door
and ran straight up to my room.  I was too excited
to bother much about what I took with me.  I just
stuffed a few things in my bag, and then I crept downstairs
again, and got out of the house as quick as ever
I could."
</p>

<p>
"Did you feel afraid?" asked Tony.
</p>

<p>
"Not till I got to the station.  Then I found I had
ten minutes to wait for a train and that was awful.
I kept on thinking Uncle Philip would turn up every
moment.  I stopped in the ladies' waiting-room as
long as I could, and then I made a dash for the
platform and jumped into the first carriage I came to.  It
was full of old women, and they all stared at me as
if I was mad.  I felt horribly red and uncomfortable,
but I wasn't going to get out again, so I just
squeezed into a seat and shut my eyes and let them
stare."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't blame them," said Tony.  "It's
the special privilege of cats to scrutinize Royalty."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I didn't mind really.  I am sort of accustomed
to it.  People used to stare at me in France
when I went in a train.  I expect it's my red hair."  She
paused.  "All the same I was glad when we got
to Waterloo.  I was so excited I could hardly breathe
till I was past the barrier, and then I nearly
collapsed.  I know now just how an animal feels when
he gets out of a trap."  She turned to Tony.  "You
don't think I'm an awful coward, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"I think you are as brave as a lion," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't feel it then," she answered.  "I was
trembling all over and my heart was thumping like
anything.  I sat down on a seat for a minute, and
then I thought I would go into the refreshment
room and have a cup of tea.  You see I had come
away without any dinner."
</p>

<p>
"You poor dear!" said Tony feelingly.  "Of
course you had!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I got up from the seat, and I was just
looking round to see where the refreshment room was,
when I suddenly caught sight of two men staring at
me like anything."
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;not our two comic opera pals?" exclaimed Tony.
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded emphatically.  "Yes," she said,
"that's who it was.  They were standing over by
the bookstall talking together.  They turned away
directly I looked at them, but I knew perfectly well
they were watching me.  I had never seen either of
them before and it made me feel horribly frightened
again.  I thought that perhaps Uncle had telephoned
up to London, and that they were two policemen who
had come to fetch me back."
</p>

<p>
"You can always tell an English policeman when
he is in plain clothes," interrupted Tony.  "He looks
so fearfully ashamed of himself."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know," said Isabel.  "I was too upset
to think much, and when they came after me into
the refreshment room I could simply have screamed.
I thought they were going to speak to me then, but
they didn't.  They just sat there while I had my tea,
and then followed me out on to the platform.  I
asked a porter what was the best way to get to Long
Acre, and he told me to take the tube to Leicester
Square.  I hoped and hoped I'd manage to lose
them, but it was no good.  They came along in the
same carriage and got out at Leicester Square, too."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I'd been with you," said Tony regretfully.
"I have never been traced or shadowed or anything
like that.  It must be a wonderful feeling."
</p>

<p>
"It was awful in the lift," said Isabel.  "I hadn't
the least notion which way to go when I got out, and
I felt certain they would come up and speak to me.  I
was so desperate that just as the lift stopped I turned
round to the lady who was standing next me and
asked her if she could show me the way to Long Acre.
You can imagine how pleased I was when she said
she was going in that direction and I could walk
along with her."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose they crept stealthily after you," said
Tony.  "People always do that in books when they
are shadowing anybody."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose they did," said Isabel.  "I was much
too frightened to look round.  I just walked along
with the lady till we got to the door of the flats, and
then I thanked her very much and ran upstairs as fast
as I could.  Miss Watson's number was right at the
top of the building.  There was no bell, so I hammered
on the knocker, and then I stood there panting
and trying to get my breath, and thinking every
moment I should hear them coming up the stairs after
me.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I stood there and stood there, and nothing
happened, and then suddenly it came to me as if&mdash;oh,
just as if somebody had dropped a lump of ice down
inside my dress.  Suppose Miss Watson had left!
You see I had been so excited about getting away from
Richmond I had never thought of that.  For a
second it made me feel quite ill; then I grabbed hold
of the knocker, and I was just beginning to hammer
again, when the door of the opposite flat opened and
an old gentleman came out on to the landing.  He
was a fat, cross-looking old man, with spectacles and
carpet slippers, and a newspaper in his hand.  He
said to me: 'It's no good making that horrible noise.
Miss Watson has gone away for a month, and there's
no one in the place.'  Then he banged the door and
went back into the flat."
</p>

<p>
"Dyspeptic old brute," observed Tony.  "I hope
you went on hammering."
</p>

<p>
"What was the good?" said Isabel with a little
despairing gesture.  "I knew he was speaking the
truth because I had already made enough noise to
wake up twenty people.  Besides I seemed to have
gone all sort of numbed and stupid.  I had so
counted on finding Miss Watson I had never even
begun to think what would happen if she wasn't
there."
</p>

<p>
"It must have been a shattering blow," said Tony.
"I think I should have burst into tears."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't cry; I was too dazed and miserable.
I just leaned where I was against the wall and
wondered what on earth I was to do next.  The only
thing I could think of was to go to a hotel.  I had
no money, except what was left out of the half-crown,
but I had got my rings and I knew I could sell
them the next day.  It was the two men outside
that I was so frightened of.  I felt certain they were
policemen, and that if I went anywhere they would
be sure to follow me and then telegraph to Uncle
Philip where I was.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how long I stayed on the landing.
It seemed an age, but I expect it was only about half
an hour really.  I thought that perhaps if I stopped
there long enough they might get tired of waiting
and go away.
</p>

<p>
"At last I began to feel so cold and hungry and
tired I simply couldn't stand it any longer.  I came
downstairs again as far as the hall, and then I walked
across to the door and looked out into the street.  I
couldn't see a sign of anybody waiting about, so I just
sort of set my teeth and stepped out on to the
pavement.  I stood there for a second wondering which
way to go, and then almost before I knew what was
happening there I was with my back against the wall,
and those two horrible men in front of me."
</p>

<p>
She paused with a little reminiscent gasp.
</p>

<p>
"And the rest of the acts of Isabel and all that she
did," began Tony; then he broke off with a laugh.
"What was it our squint-eyed friend was actually
saying to you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't so much what he said," answered
Isabel; "it was what he said it in.  He spoke to me
in Livadian."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded composedly.  "I thought so," he
observed.
</p>

<p>
"He said: 'Don't be frightened, Madam; we are
your friends.'  At least I think it was that.  I was
too upset to listen to him properly; and the next
moment you came."  She drew in a long breath.
"Oh, I was pleased," she added simply.
</p>

<p>
"So was I," said Tony, "and so was Bugg.  In
fact I think we were all pleased except your friends."  He
paused.  "Are you quite sure you hadn't seen
either of them before?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded.  "Quite," she said.  "I never
forget faces; especially faces like that."
</p>

<p>
"They <i>are</i> the sort that would linger in one's
memory," said Tony.  He got up from the seat
and stood for a moment with his hands in
his side-pockets looking thoughtfully down at
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Now you know everything," she began hesitatingly.
"Are you&mdash;are you still certain you
wouldn't like me to go away?"
</p>

<p>
"Go away!" repeated Tony.  "My incomparable
cousin, what are you talking about?"
</p>

<p>
"But just think," she pleaded.  "It may mean all
sorts of trouble.  I don't know who those two men
are or what they want, but I've got a sort of horrible
feeling they will find me out again somehow.  And
then there's my uncle and Da Freitas."  She gave a
little shiver.  "Oh, you don't know Da Freitas as I
do.  There's nothing he will stop at to get me
back&mdash;absolutely nothing."
</p>

<p>
Tony smiled happily.  "I quite believe you," he
said.  "I should think he was a most unscrupulous
brute.  People with those smooth purry voices always
are."  Then with that sudden infectious laugh he
took his hands from his pockets and held them out to
Isabel, who after a momentary hesitation put out
her own to meet them.  "My dear Isabel," he said,
almost seriously; "haven't you grasped the great fact
that this is the most colossal jest ever arranged by
Providence?  I should see it through to the end if
I had to get up to breakfast every day for the rest
of my life."  He paused with a twinkle in his eyes.
"Unless, of course, you really want to be Queen of
Livadia."
</p>

<p>
"Me!" exclaimed Isabel, with the same fine
disregard for grammar.  "Why, I never want to see the
hateful place again.  There's nothing I would love
better than just to stay with you&mdash;I mean of
course," she added hastily, "until Miss Watson
comes back."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly releasing her hands, Isabel too got
up from the seat.
</p>

<p>
"It's only that I don't want to be a trouble or&mdash;or
an expense," she added a little confusedly.
</p>

<p>
"As far as the expense goes," said Tony, "the
matter is already settled.  I have consulted one of
the most eminent pawnbrokers in London, and he
tells me that your great-grandmother had a very
pretty taste in jewellery.  There will be no need
to pawn the rings.  He let me have seven thousand
pounds on the brooch alone."
</p>

<p>
"Seven thousand pounds," echoed Isabel with a
gasp.  "Oh, but how lovely!  I can live on that for
ever."  She hesitated for a moment.  "They are
part of the Royal collection you know.  Pedro
gave them to me when we were betrothed&mdash;at
least I don't suppose he really meant me to keep
them."
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed joyously.  "What fun!" he
exclaimed.  "I should love to have seen Da Freitas'
face when he heard you had taken them with you.
Though as a matter of fact," he added, "we shall
probably see it quite soon enough, unless Uncle
Phil was too agitated to recognize me."
</p>

<p>
"Recognize you?" repeated Isabel, opening her
eyes.  "Why he has never seen you before this
morning!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he has," said Tony.  "I happened to be in
the hall of the Club yesterday, when he came rushing
in to tell Da Freitas that you had disappeared.  At
least I imagine that was what he came for.  He
could hardly have been so beautifully excited about
anything else."
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear!" exclaimed Isabel in dismay.  "Then
if he saw you in the car he will be able to find out who
you are from Da Freitas."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "One can't have all the trumps,"
he observed philosophically.  "It would be an awfully
dull game if one did."
</p>

<p>
There was a second's pause.  Then with a sudden
impulsive gesture Isabel clasped her hands together
in front of her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care," she remarked defiantly.  "I'm
not frightened of them.  I don't believe I shall be
frightened of anything&mdash;not with you to help me."

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
THE ROYAL ENTERPRISE
</h3>

<p>
The mellow-toned grandfather clock in the corner
chimed out the stroke of nine-thirty as Guy crossed
the hall with a bundle of papers in his hand.  He had
reached the foot of the banisters and was preparing
to ascend, when his progress was brought to a sudden
standstill.
</p>

<p>
Coming down the broad oak staircase, with the
inevitable cigarette between his lips, was the smiling
and fully dressed figure of Sir Antony Conway.
</p>

<p>
Guy stared at him incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious, Tony!" he observed.  "Do you
mean to say you have got up to breakfast two days
running?"
</p>

<p>
"I have," said Tony with some dignity.  "As the
prospective member for Balham North, I feel it's
my duty to be thoroughly English."  He reached
the bottom of the stairs and slipped his arm through
his cousin's.  "I have told Spalding that I will have
porridge, eggs and bacon, marmalade, and a copy of
the <i>Times</i>," he added.  "Come along into the study
and help me to face them."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am pretty busy this morning," said Guy,
"but I would sacrifice a good deal for the sake of
seeing you reading the <i>Times</i> and eating a proper healthy
breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't suppose I shall go as far as that,"
said Tony.  "I shall probably only look at them.
There is no point in carrying things to extremes."
</p>

<p>
He pushed open the door of the study, where they
discovered Spalding in the act of putting the finishing
touches to a charmingly appointed breakfast table.
</p>

<p>
With a final glance of approval at his handiwork,
that well-trained servitor stepped back and pulled
out a chair for Tony.
</p>

<p>
"Is everything ready?" inquired the latter.
</p>

<p>
"Quite ready, Sir Antony," replied Spalding.
"The copy of the <i>Times</i> is beside your plate, sir.
You will find the engineering supplement inside."
</p>

<p>
He brought up another chair for Guy, and then
retiring to a small electric lift in the wall, produced
the eggs and bacon and porridge which he placed on
the sideboard upon a couple of carefully trimmed and
already lighted spirit stoves.
</p>

<p>
"You needn't wait, Spalding," said Tony.  "I
like to help myself at breakfast; it's more in keeping
with the best English traditions."
</p>

<p>
Spalding bowed, and crossing to the door closed it
noiselessly behind him.
</p>

<p>
Tony began leisurely to pour himself out a cup of
tea.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you have had your breakfast, Guy?"
he observed.
</p>

<p>
The latter nodded.  "I have," he said, "but if you
are going to keep up this excellent habit of early
rising, I shall wait for you in future."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do," said Tony.  "Then we can read out
the best bits in the <i>Times</i> to each other.  Henry and
Laura do it every morning at breakfast."  He took
a sip out of the cup and lighted himself a fresh
cigarette.  "By the way," he added.  "I am going to
meet them at lunch to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" inquired Guy.
</p>

<p>
"At Aunt Fanny's.  She sent me a sort of S.O.S. call
this morning saying that they were coming and
imploring help.  I can't leave her alone with them.
She is getting too old for really hard work."
</p>

<p>
"I believe Aunt Fanny deliberately encourages
you to laugh at them," said Guy severely.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want any encouragement," protested
Tony, helping himself to a delicately browned piece of
toast.
</p>

<p>
"If I didn't laugh at Laura I should weep."
</p>

<p>
"You would do much better if you listened a bit
more to what they said.  But of course it's no use
offering you any advice."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, it is," said Tony.  "That's where you
wrong me."  He leaned back in his chair and looked
mischievously across at his cousin.  "I pay the most
careful attention to everything you tell me, Guy.
At the present moment I am seriously thinking of
following some advice you gave me yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"What about?" asked Guy suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
Tony broke off a little piece of toast and crunched
it thoughtfully between his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"About Cousin Isabel," he replied.
</p>

<p>
Something remarkably like a faint flush of colour
mounted into Guy's face.
</p>

<p>
"Really!" he observed with an admirable indifference.
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded gently.  "Certain things which have
come to my knowledge since have made me feel that
perhaps you were right in what you said.  I doubt
whether I should be justified in risking my political
career for the sake of a passing whim.  After all one
has to think of the country."
</p>

<p>
Guy looked at him with mistrust.  "You don't
suppose I shall swallow that," he observed.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter," said Tony sadly.  "I am
used to being misunderstood."  He paused.  "What
did you think of Isabel?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Guy was evidently prepared for the question.  "I
was pleasantly surprised with her," he admitted.
"She seemed to me a very attractive girl, and I
should think quite straightforward."
</p>

<p>
Again Tony nodded his head.  "Yes," he said,
"I think that's true.  It makes me all the more
sorry I can't go on helping her."
</p>

<p>
"Can't go on helping her!" repeated Guy.  "What
do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she told me her history yesterday, and it's
not at all the sort of thing a rising young politician
ought to be mixed up with.  She admitted as much
herself.  I am afraid the only thing to do is to get
rid of her as quickly as we can."
</p>

<p>
Guy sat up indignantly.  "I don't know what you
are talking about," he said, "but I am quite sure
you have misunderstood her in some way or other.
Anyhow what you suggest is impossible.  You can't
pick up people and drop them again in this thoughtless
and selfish fashion.  What's the girl to do?  You
have chosen to make yourself responsible for her, and
you must arrange to send her back to her people&mdash;or
something."
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately," said Tony, "there are difficulties
in the way.  Her father and mother are both dead,
and her nearest relations are all out of work for the
moment."
</p>

<p>
"Has she any profession?" asked Guy.
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she's a queen."
</p>

<p>
There was a short silence.  "A <i>what</i>?" demanded Guy.
</p>

<p>
"A queen!" repeated Tony.  "It's not a profession
that I altogether approve of for women, but she
had been brought up to it, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Guy pushed back his chair.  "Look here, Tony,"
he exclaimed, "what on earth are you talking about?"
</p>

<p>
Tony raised his eyebrows.  "Isabel," he explained
patiently.  "Cousin Isabel.  The nice little red-haired
girl you were teaching gardening to yesterday.
She is the only daughter of that late lamented
inebriate&mdash;Don Francisco of Livadia."
</p>

<p>
With a startled ejaculation Guy suddenly sat up
straight in his chair.  He opened his mouth as if to
speak, but nothing intelligible seemed to suggest itself.
</p>

<p>
"Furthermore," pursued Tony tranquilly, "she
is the affianced wife of our illustrious little pal King
Pedro the Fifth.  That of course explains why she
has run away."
</p>

<p>
By a supreme effort Guy succeeded in regaining his
lost powers of conversation.  His face was a beautiful
study in amazement, dismay, and incredulity.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but&mdash;Good Heavens!" he gasped; "This
can't be true!  You must be joking!"
</p>

<p>
"Joking!" repeated Tony sternly.  "Of course
I'm not joking.  No respectable Englishman ever
jokes at breakfast."
</p>

<p>
Guy threw up his hands with a gesture that was
almost tragic.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if it's true," he observed, "you have just
about gone and done it this time with a vengeance."  He
got up from his seat, took a couple of agitated
paces towards the window, and then came back to
the table where the future member for Balham
North was still placidly munching his toast.  "Good
Lord, Tony!" he exclaimed; "don't you understand
what a serious matter this is?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do," said Tony.  "You don't suppose
I would talk about it at breakfast otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"It's more than serious," continued Guy in a
strained voice.  "It's&mdash;it's the most unholy mess
that even you have ever mixed yourself up in.  If
this girl is really who you say she is, we shall have
the whole diplomatic service tumbling over
themselves to find her."  He paused.  "For goodness'
sake tell me the whole story at once; there may
possibly be some way out of it after all."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think there is," said Tony contentedly.
"Of course I could desert Isabel, but as you have
just pointed out to me, that would be very brutal
and dishonourable.  Anyhow, if you will take a pew
and try and look a little less like Sarah Bernhardt,
I'll tell you exactly how things stand.  Then you can
judge for yourself."
</p>

<p>
Guy resumed his seat, and after pausing to light
himself a third cigarette, Tony began to repeat
Isabel's romantic history, more or less as she had
described it to him at Cookham on the previous day.
There was a leisurely style about his method that
must have been somewhat provoking to Guy, whose
anxiety to hear the whole truth seemed to be of a
painful intensity.  Tony, however, proceeded in his
own unhurried fashion, and by a masterly exhibition
of self-control Guy refrained from any comment
or interruption until the entire story was told.
</p>

<p>
Then he sat back in his chair with the stony
expression of one who has learnt the worst.
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at him sympathetically.  "One can't
very well get out of it, can one, Guy?" he observed.
"Of course I might give Isabel a week's notice, but
after the bitter and scornful way you spoke to me
just now about my selfishness I should hardly like to
do that.  Besides, as a moral man I strongly
disapprove of Pedro's intentions.  I think nobody should
be allowed to marry who has not led a perfectly
pure life."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, shut up," said Guy; "shut up and let me
think."  He buried his forehead in his hands for a
moment or two, and then looked up again with such
a harassed appearance that Tony felt quite sorry for
him.  "It's&mdash;it's worse than I thought," he added
despairingly.  "What on earth do you imagine is
going to be the end of it?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't the remotest notion," admitted Tony
cheerfully.  "The only thing I have quite made up
my mind about is that Isabel shan't be forced into
marrying Pedro."
</p>

<p>
"I agree with you there," said Guy with sudden
warmth. "It's an infamous proposal.  I can't see
what's at the bottom of it either unless there is still
a party in Livadia who believe in her father's claim.
I thought they were pretty well extinct."  He paused
for a moment, his brow puckered in deep and anxious
reflection.  "Anyhow," he added, "you have put
yourself into a frightfully delicate position.  Da
Freitas will move heaven and earth to find the girl,
and you can be quite sure he will get any possible
assistance he asks for from our people."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe he'll ask for any," said Tony.
"I've got a notion that they want to keep this
marriage business as quiet as possible.  Why should they
have tried to rush it so, otherwise?  If that's right
they will probably be only too anxious to keep the
police out of it, especially since they have seen Isabel
with me."
</p>

<p>
"But do you think her uncle recognized you?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't say," replied Tony tranquilly.  "He only
saw me for a second in the hall of the Club, and he
was so agitated then that even a beautiful face like
mine might have escaped him.  Still I should think
they were bound to get on our track sooner or later.
That's the worst of a carelessly built place like
London.  One always runs into the people one doesn't
want to meet."
</p>

<p>
"There are those other men too," said Guy, who
was evidently pondering each point in the
problem&mdash;"the men who are following her about.  What do
you make of them?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to make an example of them," said
Tony firmly.  "I really can't have dirty foreigners
hanging about outside my house.  It's so bad for
one's reputation."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do be serious for a moment," pleaded Guy
almost angrily.  "We are in this business now, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>We!</i>" echoed Tony with pleasure.  "My dear
Guy!  Do you really mean that you're going to lend
us your powerful aid?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am," said Guy impatiently.  "I
think you were very foolish to mix yourself up in
the affair at all, but since you have chosen to do it,
you don't suppose that I shall desert you.  If ever
you wanted assistance I should say you did now."
</p>

<p>
Tony leaned across, and taking his cousin's hand,
shook it warmly over the breakfast table.
</p>

<p>
"Dear old Guy," he observed.  "I always thought
that under a rather forbidding exterior you
concealed the heart of a true sportsman."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," returned Guy.  "I am your secretary,
and it's my business to look after you when
you make an idiot of yourself."  He paused.  "Besides,"
he added, "there is the girl to be considered."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "Yes," he said, "we must consider
Isabel.  By the way I have never thanked you
for being so nice to her yesterday.  She told me that
you were perfectly charming."
</p>

<p>
For a second time Guy's face assumed a faint tinge
of colour.
</p>

<p>
"One couldn't help feeling sorry for the child when
one spoke to her," he said stiffly.  "It appears to be
no fault of her own that she has been put in this
impossible position."  He hesitated for a moment.
"I hope to goodness, Tony," he added, "that you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed softly.  "It's quite all right," he
said.  "Don't be alarmed, Guy.  My feelings
towards Isabel are as innocent as the dawn."  He
glanced at the slim gold watch that he wore on his
wrist, and then in a leisurely fashion got up from his
chair.  "I hate to break up this charming breakfast
party," he said, "but I must be off.  I am going
to look up Isabel on my way to Aunt Fanny's.  I
want to see how many intruding strangers Bugg has
murdered in the night."
</p>

<p>
Guy also rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Tony," he said.  "Let us understand each
other quite clearly.  However you choose to look at
it, this is an uncommonly serious business&mdash;and there
are some very ugly possibilities in it.  We can't
afford to treat it as a joke&mdash;not if you really want to
keep Isabel out of these people's hands."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded his head.  "I know that, Guy," he
said.  "I can't help my incurable light-heartedness,
but I can assure you that Cousin Henry himself
couldn't be more deadly serious about it than I am.
I promise you faithfully I won't play the fool."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," said Guy.  "In that case you
can count on me to the utmost."
</p>

<p>
It was about a quarter of an hour later when Tony
pulled up the big Peugot outside Mrs. Spalding's,
and climbing down from his seat pushed open the
gate.  As he did so the door of the house was opened
in turn by Bugg, who presented a singularly spruce
and animated appearance.  His hair had evidently
been brushed and brilliantined with extreme care,
and he was wearing a tight-fitting black and white
check suit that reminded one of a carefully made
draught-board.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Bugg," said Tony, as he came up
the steps.  "You look very beautiful."
</p>

<p>
Bugg saluted with a slightly embarrassed smile.
</p>

<p>
"I brought along me Sunday togs, Sir Ant'ny;
seein' as 'ow I was to be livin' in the 'ouse with
two ladies."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, Bugg," said Tony approvingly.
"It's just that thoughtfulness in small matters that
makes the true artist in life."  He paused to pull off
his driving gloves.  "Is there any news?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Bugg cast a quick warning glance over his shoulder
into the house.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere's the young laidy, sir," he replied in a hoarse
whisper.  "See yer ahtside after."
</p>

<p>
He moved away as Isabel came lightly down the
stairs, and advanced along the passage to meet them.
</p>

<p>
She greeted Tony with just the faintest touch of
shyness, and then led the way into the small
sitting-room on the right.
</p>

<p>
Here she held out her hand to him, and bowing
over it with extreme gravity, Tony kissed the pink
tip of one of her fingers.
</p>

<p>
"I trust your Majesty slept well?" he observed.
</p>

<p>
She pulled away her hand.  "Oh, please don't
tease me," she said.  "You can't imagine how funny
I feel about it all."  She paused.  "If we hadn't met
Uncle Philip yesterday, I believe I should have begun
to think the whole thing was a dream."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it is," said Tony.  "Personally I
shouldn't be a bit surprised if I woke up and found
Spalding standing by my bed with a cup of tea."
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter really anyway," said Isabel,
"because we are all dreaming the same thing, aren't
we?  You and I and Bugg, and&mdash;and your cousin
Mr. Guy."
</p>

<p>
"Guy certainly is," answered Tony.  "You have
made a positively devastating conquest of poor Guy.
How on earth did you manage to do it?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel opened her amber eyes.  "I don't know,"
she said innocently.  "He was very nice and kind.
I only talked to him and smiled at him."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that accounts for it," said Tony solemnly.
</p>

<p>
He put his hat down and seated himself on the sofa.
"You really ought to be more careful," he added.
"It isn't fair to go about bewitching respectable
secretaries.  You never know what they may turn into."
</p>

<p>
"Have you told him?" asked Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"Everything," said Tony.  "He is yearning to
plunge into the fray and re-seat you on the throne
of Livadia.  I left him practising sword exercises in
the hall."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed, and opening the bag that was
lying on the table beside her took out a little silver
cigarette case, which she offered to Tony.
</p>

<p>
"Do have one," she said.  "I bought it yesterday
afternoon out of the money you gave me.  It was
very extravagant, but I love shopping.  You see I
have not been allowed to do any in London."
</p>

<p>
Tony, who never smoked anything but Virginian
tobacco, helped himself bravely to a gold tipped
product of the Turkish Empire, and lit it with apparent
zest.
</p>

<p>
"All the truest pleasure in life comes from doing
things one hasn't been allowed to do," he observed.
"To enjoy anything properly one ought to go in for
a long course of self-denial first."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I suppose you're right," said Isabel doubtfully,
"but it's rather difficult, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I should think it was," said Tony.  "I have
never tried it myself."  He felt in his pocket for a
moment, and then pulled out a cheque book, which
bore the stamped address of the same Hampstead
bank at which he kept his own account.
</p>

<p>
"This is yours, Isabel," he said handing it across
to her.  "I have paid the money I got for the brooch
into your account, so you can go on shopping as long
and fiercely as you like.  Do you know how to draw
a cheque?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded.  "Oh, yes," she said.  "You just
fill it in and write your name at the bottom, and
then they give you the money.  It's quite easy, isn't
it."
</p>

<p>
"Quite," said Tony.  "All real miracles are."
</p>

<p>
Isabel slipped away the cheque book into her bag.
Then she looked at Tony with that half childish and
wholly delightful smile of hers.
</p>

<p>
"Now I am rich," she said.  "I can begin
entertaining."  She hesitated.  "Should I be doing
anything very dreadful&mdash;I&mdash;I mean from the English
point of view&mdash;if I asked you to come and have
dinner with me somewhere to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course you wouldn't," said Tony firmly.  "A
queen has an absolutely free hand about things like
that.  It's what is called the Royal Prerogative.
There is a well established precedent in the case of
Queen Elizabeth and the Earl of Leicester."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right then," said Isabel in a relieved
voice.  "What time will you come?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite early," said Tony.  "In fact I think I will
come to tea if I may.  I am lunching with Cousin
Henry and his wife and that always makes me
thirsty."  He glanced at his watch, and then got
up from the sofa.  "I mustn't stop any longer now,"
he added.  "I have several things to do before I get
to Chester Square, and it's so rude to keep people
waiting for lunch.  Besides it spoils the lunch."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed happily, and rising to her feet gave
him her hand again&mdash;this time with little or no trace
of her former shyness.  Indeed it was difficult to be
shy with Tony for any very extended period.
</p>

<p>
"I will see that you have some nice tea anyway,"
she said.  "I will make it for you myself."
</p>

<p>
Tony paused for a moment on the threshold of
the house to exchange his Turkish cigarette for a
Virginian, and then strolled off down the garden
towards the gate.  As he approached the latter it
was opened for him by "Tiger" Bugg, who had
apparently been waiting patiently beside the car.
</p>

<p>
"Don't look hup, sir," observed that distinguished
welter-weight in a low earnest voice.  "Jest carry on
saime as if we was talkin' abaht nothin' partic'lar."
</p>

<p>
With an air of complete indifference Tony strolled
across the pavement to the front of the car and lifted
up the bonnet.  Bugg followed, and bent over the
exposed engine beside him, as though pointing out
some minor deficiency.
</p>

<p>
"There's one of them blokes watchin' of us,"
continued "Tiger" in the same confidential tone.
"'E's be'ind the fence opposite.  Bin 'anging arahnd
'ere all the blinkin' morning."
</p>

<p>
"Really!" said Tony gently.  "Which of them is it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the shorter one, sir.  The one I give that
flip in the jaw to.  I seen 'im w'en I come aht o' the
front door this mornin'.  'E was doin' a sorter boy
scout stunt be'ind the bushes, and I 'ad 'alf a mind to
land 'im with one o' them loose bricks.  Then I
remembers wot you'd said yesterday&mdash;abaht lyin'
low like&mdash;so I jest 'urns a toon and pretends I 'adn't
spotted 'im."
</p>

<p>
"You have the true instincts of a sleuth, Bugg,"
observed Tony approvingly.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't be 'alf surprised if they was both
abaht somewhere," went on the gratified "Tiger" in
a hoarse whisper.  "It's my belief, sir, that they
mean to 'ang arahnd until they sees a chance of gettin'
at the young laidy without no interruptions from us.
I'd bet a dollar that if I was to clear off the plaice
for 'arf an hour, they'd be shovin' their dirty selves
into the 'ouse all right&mdash;some'ow or other."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" exclaimed Tony softly.  "You have
given me an idea, Bugg&mdash;a brilliant idea."
</p>

<p>
He continued to reflect in silence for a moment or
two, and then at last he shut down the bonnet with
that particularly pleasant smile of his which Guy
always declared to be the sure harbinger of
approaching trouble.
</p>

<p>
"I shall return about four o'clock, Bugg," he said.
"I think we may have an interesting and instructive
afternoon ahead of us&mdash;thanks to you."
</p>

<p>
Bugg sighed happily.  "I'll be 'ere, sir," he
observed.  "I'd like to see that there tall bloke again.
I 'ate leavin' a job 'alf finished."
</p>

<p>
"And meanwhile," said Tony, "take particular
care of Miss Francis.  It's quite possible there
may be somebody else wanting to speak to her
privately besides our pals opposite."
</p>

<p>
Bugg's eyes gleamed.  "It don't make no difference
to me, sir, 'ow many of 'em there is.  Nothin'
doin'.  That's my motter as far as visitors goes."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded approvingly, and entering the car
started off down the hill, leaving Bugg standing
grimly at the gate, in an attitude that must have
been deeply discouraging to any concealed gentleman
who might be hoping for an early entrance.
</p>

<p>
After visiting his tailor in Sackville Street, and
discharging one or two other less momentous duties,
Tony made his way to Chester Square, where he
pulled up outside Lady Jocelyn's house, exactly as
the clock of St. Peter's was striking one-thirty.
</p>

<p>
Punctual as he was Laura and Henry had arrived
before him.  He heard the former's rich contralto
voice in full swing as the maid preceded him up the
staircase, and it was with that vague feeling of
depression the sound invariably inspired in him that
he entered the charmingly furnished little drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn, who looked rather like an old ivory
miniature, was sitting on the sofa, and going up to her
Tony bent over and kissed her affectionately.  Then
he shook hands with both his cousins.
</p>

<p>
"I have been hearing the most wonderful things
about you, Tony," said Lady Jocelyn.  "If I didn't
dislike veal so much I should certainly have killed
the fatted calf for lunch.  Is it really true that you
are going to become the member for&mdash;for&mdash;where is
it, Laura?"
</p>

<p>
"Balham North," remarked Laura firmly.
</p>

<p>
She was a tall fair-haired lady, with thin lips, a
masterful nose, and a pair of relentless blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I believe it's quite true, Aunt Fanny," returned
Tony.  "In fact I understand it has all been arranged
except for the formality of consulting the natives."
</p>

<p>
"How splendid," said Lady Jocelyn.  "And who
are the natives?  I always thought Balham was still
unexplored."
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "Oh, no," he said.  "Henry
has been right into the interior.  He can even speak
the language&mdash;can't you, Henry?"
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing to laugh at about Balham,"
said Henry a little stiffly.  "It is one of the best
residential suburbs in London."
</p>

<p>
"And extremely well educated politically," put in
Laura in her clear incisive voice.  "I have been
looking into the matter, and I find that our various
temperance and purity leagues have no less than
seven branches there, and that the reports from all
of them are distinctly encouraging.  On the whole I
regard it as one of the must hopeful constituencies
in London."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn looked a little puzzled.  "What do
they hope for?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Lunch, m'lady," remarked the parlour-maid,
opening the door.
</p>

<p>
"In that case," said Tony gravely, "they couldn't
have chosen a more efficient representative."
</p>

<p>
Like the wise woman she was, Lady Jocelyn always
had an excellent cook, and a single glance at the menu
as they settled themselves down round the table had
an inspiriting effect upon the entire party.  Even
Laura was not wholly exempt from its influence.
Though a stern advocate of the superior food value
of lentils and beans as far as the poor were concerned,
she herself had a very handsome appreciation for the
less scientific forms of diet.  She ate with
enthusiasm and staying power; after a second helping of
mousse of ham and cold asparagus, she became more
affable than Tony had ever seen her.
</p>

<p>
"I can hardly describe the satisfaction that Tony's
decision to stand has given to Henry and me," she
observed to Lady Jocelyn.  "We have been trying
for years to persuade him to do something worthy
of his position.  A life of empty pleasure is such
an appallingly bad example for the poor."
</p>

<p>
"I am not quite sure that I agree with you there,"
said Tony.  "I believe the possibility of being able to
live eventually in complete idleness is one of the few
real incentives to hard work.  There ought to be one
or two examples about, so that people can realize
how pleasant that sort of life is."
</p>

<p>
"You have done your share, Tony," said Lady
Jocelyn consolingly.  "You will be able to go to sleep
in the House of Commons with a perfectly clear
conscience."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you are joking, Aunt Fanny," said
Henry.  "You are much too well informed to believe
that sort of nonsense.  I doubt if there is a more
arduous profession in the world than being a member
of Parliament&mdash;provided of course that a man takes
his work seriously.  Tony has promised us that he
will do that."
</p>

<p>
"And we shall be there to keep him up to it,"
added Laura crisply.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn looked at Tony with some sympathy.
"I only hope he won't break down," she said.  "It's
not everyone who can stand these severe strains."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Tony's as sound as a bell," returned Henry a
little contemptuously.  "Hard work will do him all
the good in the world&mdash;it's just what he wants.  I
have been advising him to take up some special
subject and master it thoroughly before he goes into the
House.  It's the only way to get on quickly
nowadays."  He turned to Tony.  "Have you thought
that over at all yet?  I mean do you feel a special
leaning towards any particular question?"
</p>

<p>
Tony took a long drink of champagne and put
down his glass.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Henry," he said, "during the last two days
I have discovered that foreign politics have a
remarkable attraction for me."
</p>

<p>
"Foreign politics!" repeated Henry.  "Well,
they're an interesting subject, but I should have
thought you would have found them a little
too&mdash;too&mdash;what shall we say&mdash;too remote."
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "No," he said, "I haven't
found that.  Of course I don't know very much
about them yet, but I expect to be learning quite a
lot before long."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's the right spirit anyway," said Henry
heartily.  "When I get back I will instruct my
secretary to send you along some White Books to
study.  Remember if there is anything we can do to
help you&mdash;introductions you would like or anything
of that sort&mdash;don't hesitate to ask us."
</p>

<p>
"I won't," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
Harmoniously as matters had been proceeding up
to this point, the remainder of the lunch party was
even more of a pronounced success.  It was evident
that Tony's sudden and surprising absorption in
world politics was highly approved of both by Henry
and Laura, who seemed to regard it as a sign that he
was beginning to take his Parliamentary career with
becoming seriousness.  If at times old Lady Jocelyn's
twinkling black eyes suggested a certain amount of
scepticism in the matter, she at least said nothing
to disturb this pleasant impression, while Tony
himself sustained his new rôle with that imperturbable
ease of manner which never seemed to desert him.
</p>

<p>
It was nearly half-past three before Laura and
Henry rose to go, and then they took their leave with
an approving friendliness that reminded one of a
tutor saying good-bye to a promising pupil.
</p>

<p>
"I will have those White Books sent round at
once," said Henry, warmly shaking his cousin's hand.
"There is a new one just issued dealing with the
Patagonia boundary dispute.  You will find it most
interesting."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds ripping," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
"And you needn't worry a bit about your election,"
added Laura.  "Henry's seat is so safe that
I shall be able to give up my entire time to helping
you."
</p>

<p>
"That <i>will</i> be nice, won't it, Tony?" said Lady
Jocelyn innocently.
</p>

<p>
She rose to her feet with the aid of her ebony stick,
and taking Henry's arm accompanied him and
Laura to the head of the staircase, where she said
good-bye to them both.  She then came back into the
room, and closing the door behind her, shook her head
slowly and reprovingly at the future member for
Balham North.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to know exactly what pleasant
surprise you are preparing for them, Tony," she said.
</p>

<p>
Tony came up, and putting his arm round her,
conducted her gently to her customary place on the
sofa.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if the Prodigal Son had a sceptical
aunt?" he said sadly.
</p>

<p>
With a little chuckle Lady Jocelyn settled herself
into her seat.  "Probably," she replied; "and if she
carved the veal I have no doubt she gave him the best
helping."
</p>

<p>
Tony stood back and surveyed her affectionately.
"Do you know what an Enterprise is, Aunt Fanny?"
he asked.  "An Enterprise with a large capital E at
the beginning?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn looked up at him with an air of mild
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I believe it is a thing that people prosecute,"
she replied.  "Why do you ask?"
</p>

<p>
"I am engaged on one," said Tony.  "I can't
tell you what it is to-day, because I have got to go in
three minutes, and I always stammer if I try to talk
quickly.  Besides it's too interesting to hurry over."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Tony," said Lady Jocelyn; "you fill
me with curiosity.  If you don't come round again
soon and tell me all about it I shall never forgive
you."
</p>

<p>
"I shall come," said Tony.  "I fancy it's going to
be one of those enterprises which will absorb a good
deal of advice and assistance."
</p>

<p>
"You can count on mine," said Lady Jocelyn,
"even if I have to imperil my hitherto unblemished
reputation in Chester Square."
</p>

<p>
Tony bent down and kissed her cheek.  "Dear
Aunt Fanny," he said.  "I should certainly propose
to you if it wasn't forbidden in the prayer-book."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn laughed and patted his hand.  "I
appreciate the compliment, Tony," she said, "but
perhaps it's just as well as it is.  I am getting old,
and you would be a very bad preparation for the next
world."  She paused.  "Remember," she added; "if
you don't come back within three days and tell me
all about the Enterprise I shall put the matter in the
hands of the S.P.C.A."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" inquired Tony.
</p>

<p>
"The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Aunts," said Lady Jocelyn.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A slight but natural reluctance on the part of the
Peugot to leave such a select neighbourhood, delayed
Tony for several minutes outside the house.  At
length, however, he managed to persuade the big
car to start, and just baffling a masterly attempt at
suicide by a passing terrier, he set off on his return
journey to Hampstead.
</p>

<p>
He did not go direct to Mrs. Spalding's, but
continued his way straight up Haverstock Hill and
across the Heath to his own house.  Here he got out
and handed the car over to the care of Jennings, who
came sauntering down from the garage in his usual
sombre fashion.
</p>

<p>
"You can put her away, Jennings," he said,
brushing the dust from his sleeve.  "If I want
anything to-night I shall take a taxi.  This perpetual
dashing about in high-powered cars is apt to induce
arrogance."
</p>

<p>
Jennings received this statement with an unmoved
expression, and leaving him to carry out his instructions,
Tony entered the hall.  He walked across to
the stick rack in the corner, where he proceeded to
select a large and particularly heavy Irish blackthorn
from the numerous specimens that it contained.
He weighed this thoughtfully in his hand, and then,
apparently satisfied with its possibilities, he lighted
himself a cigar and strolled off down the drive and out
across the Heath in the direction of Mrs. Spalding's
house.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
THE BAITED TRAP
</h3>

<p>
Latimer Lane, which was the name of the secluded
little road in which the Spaldings' house was
situated, presented a most restful appearance as
Tony entered it from the upper end.  Except for a
solitary cat sunning herself in the gutter, there was
no sign of life throughout its entire length.  If any
sinister-looking gentlemen were really lurking in the
neighbourhood, they had at least succeeded in
concealing themselves with the most praiseworthy skill.
</p>

<p>
With his blackthorn in his hand Tony sauntered
peacefully along the pavement.  There was nothing
about his appearance to suggest that he was taking
any unusual interest in his surroundings.  His whole
demeanour was as free from suspicion as that of the
cat herself, who merely opened one sleepy eye at his
approach, and then closed it again with an air of
sun-warmed indifference.
</p>

<p>
He turned in at the gate of Mrs. Spalding's house
without so much as a backward glance, and strolling
up the garden path, knocked lightly at the door.  It
was opened almost immediately by Bugg, whose
face lit up with that same sort of simple-hearted
smile that Ney used to assume at the appearance of
Napoleon.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, sir," he whispered exultingly, as
soon as the door was closed again.  "'E's still there,
an' 'tother bloke too!"
</p>

<p>
Tony hung up his hat, and with tender care
deposited his blackthorn on the hall table.
</p>

<p>
"That's splendid, Bugg," he said.  "Where is
Miss Francis?"
</p>

<p>
With a jerk of his thumb, Bugg indicated the
basement.
</p>

<p>
"She's dahn there along o' Mrs. Spalding, sir."
</p>

<p>
The words had hardly left his lips, when Isabel,
slightly flushed and looking prettier than ever,
emerged from the head of the kitchen stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, "you have just come at the right
time.  Mrs. Spalding and I have been making some
scones for tea."
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at her in admiration.  "What wild
and unexpected talents you have, Isabel," he
remarked.
</p>

<p>
She laughed happily.  "I can make very good
scones," she said.  "That was one of the extra and
private accomplishments that Miss Watson taught
me."  She paused.  "How soon would you like
to have tea?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you mind putting it off for a little bit?" said
Tony.  "I have got something I want to speak
to you about first."  He turned to Bugg.  "Go out
into the yard behind, Bugg," he said, "and have a
nice careful look at the back wall.  I want to know if
it's fairly easy to climb and what there is the other
side of it."
</p>

<p>
With that invaluable swiftness of action that
distinguishes a successful welter-weight, Bugg
wheeled round and shot off on his errand.  Isabel
gazed after him for a moment in surprise, and then
turned back to Tony with a slightly bewildered
expression.
</p>

<p>
"Is there anything the matter?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing the least serious," said Tony reassuringly.
"I am thinking of entertaining a couple of old
friends of ours who are too shy to call in the usual
way."
</p>

<p>
A sudden look of understanding flashed into
Isabel's face, and taking a quick step forward she
laid her hand lightly on Tony's arm.
</p>

<p>
"You mean those men&mdash;those two men?" she
whispered.  "Why&mdash;are they outside?  Have they
found out where I am?"
</p>

<p>
Tony patted her hand.  "There's nothing to be
frightened about, Isabel," he said.  "At least not
for us."
</p>

<p>
She drew herself up proudly.  "I'm not frightened,"
she said, "not a bit.  I told you I should never
be frightened again as long as I had you to help
me."  She took a long breath.  "What are you going to
do?" she asked.  "Kill them?"
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed.  "I think we ought to find out
first what they want," he said.  "There's a sort of
prejudice in this country against massacring people
at sight."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I forgot we were in England," said Isabel
apologetically.  "I have heard father and the others
talk so much about killing people, it doesn't seem
nearly as serious to me as it ought to."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Tony consolingly.  "We all
have our weak points."  He leaned over and tipped
off the ash of his cigar into the umbrella stand.
"According to Bugg," he added, "our two friends
have been hanging about outside the house ever since
Tuesday."
</p>

<p>
Isabel opened her eyes.  "Since Tuesday!" she
repeated.  "But why didn't you tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't want to worry you.  I knew you would
be quite safe with Bugg here, so I thought it was
better to wait until I had made up my mind what
to do."  He paused.  "Whoever these two beauties
are it's quite evident that what they're really
yearning for is another little private chat with you.
At least it's difficult to see what else they can
be after unless they are going in for a fresh air
cure."
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded her head. "It's me all right," she
observed with some conviction.
</p>

<p>
"Well, under the circumstances," pursued Tony
tranquilly, "I propose to give them the chance of
gratifying their ambition.  I always like to help
people gratify their ambition, even if it involves a
little personal trouble and exertion."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's amber eyes lit up with an expectant and
rather unkind pleasure.  "What are you going to
do?" she asked again.
</p>

<p>
"It depends to a certain extent on Bugg's report,"
replied Tony.  "The idea is that he and I should go
out by the front gate, work our way round to the back,
and make a quiet and unobtrusive re-entrance over
the garden wall.  We should then be on the premises
in case any one took it into their heads to call during
our absence."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed joyously.  "That's a lovely idea,"
she exclaimed.  "I do hope&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She was interrupted by the sudden reappearance
of Bugg, who came rapidly up the staircase in the
same noiseless and unexpected fashion that he had
departed in.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Tony, throwing away the stump of
his cigar.
</p>

<p>
"There ain't nothin' wrong abaht the wall, sir,"
replied Bugg cheerfully.  "One can 'op over that as
easy as sneezin'."
</p>

<p>
"What is there the other side of it?" asked Tony.
</p>

<p>
"It gives on to the back garden of the 'Ollies&mdash;that
big empty 'ouse in 'Eath Street."
</p>

<p>
"How very obliging of it," said Tony contentedly.
He turned to Isabel.  "It's no good wasting time, is
it?" he added.  "I think I had better go straight
down and tell Mrs. Spalding what we propose to do.
She ought to know something about it, just in case we
have to slaughter any one on her best carpet."
</p>

<p>
Isabel looked a little doubtful.  "I hope she won't
mind," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think she will," replied Tony.  "I have
always found her most reasonable about trifles."  He
turned back to Bugg.  "Better find a bag or something
to take with you when you go out," he added.
"I want you to look as if you were on your way back
to Goodman's Rest."
</p>

<p>
Bugg saluted, and making his way downstairs,
Tony tapped gently at what appeared to be the
kitchen door.  It was opened by Mrs. Spalding who
at the sight of her visitor showed distinct traces of
surprise and concern.
</p>

<p>
"Why ever didn't you ring, Sir Antony?" she
inquired almost reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, Mrs. Spalding," he replied in his
cheerful fashion.  "I came down purposely because
I want to have a little private talk with you."  He
moved aside a plate, and before she could protest
seated himself on the corner of the table.  "You
remember what I told you a couple of days ago
about the house being watched?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed yes, sir," said Mrs. Spalding.  "They
are still hanging about the place according to what
Bugg says.  I am sure I don't know what the police
can be up to allowing a thing like that to go on in a
respectable neighbourhood."
</p>

<p>
"It's scandalous," agreed Tony warmly.  "As far
as I can see the only thing to do is to take the matter
into our hands.  The men are probably a couple of
ruffians employed to watch the place by Miss
Francis' guardian."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Spalding nodded her head.  "I shouldn't be a
bit surprised, sir.  Them foreigners are up to anything."
</p>

<p>
"It must be put a stop to," said Tony firmly.
"Of course I could insist upon the police taking it
up, but I think on the whole it would be better if we
tackled the matter ourselves.  One doesn't want the
half-penny papers to get hold of it, or anything of
that sort."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not, sir," said Mrs. Spalding in a
shocked voice.  "It would never do for a gentleman
in your position."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I have thought of a plan," began Tony,
"but the fact is&mdash;" he paused artistically&mdash;"well,
the fact is, Mrs. Spalding, I should hardly like to
trouble you any further after the extremely kind way
in which you have already helped us."
</p>

<p>
The good woman was visibly affected.  "You
mustn't think of that, Sir Antony," she protested.
"I am sure it's a real pleasure to do anything I can
for you and the young lady&mdash;such a nice sweet-spoken young
lady she is too."
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course, if you really feel like that about
it," observed Tony; and without wasting efforts on
any further diplomacy, he proceeded to sketch out
the plan of campaign that he had already described
to Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite simple, you see," he finished.  "We
pop back over the garden wall and through
the kitchen window, and there we are.  Then if
these scoundrels do turn up and ask for Miss
Francis, you have only got to let them in and
leave the rest to us.  I don't think they will
bother us much more&mdash;not after I've finished
with them."
</p>

<p>
For a respectable woman, who had hitherto led a
peaceful and law-abiding life, Mrs. Spalding received
the scheme with surprising calmness.
</p>

<p>
"You will be careful about the climbing the wall,
won't you, sir?" she observed.  "It's that old,
there's no knowing whether it will bear a gentleman
of your weight."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all right, Mrs. Spalding," said Tony
reassuringly.  "I shall allow Bugg to go first."
</p>

<p>
He got down off the table, and after once more
expressing his thanks, made his way upstairs again
into the hall.
</p>

<p>
He found Isabel standing at the door of the sitting-room
just as he had left her.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" she asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"There are no difficulties," said Tony.  "Mrs. Spalding
is all for a forward policy."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke there was a sound of footsteps above
them, and Bugg descended the staircase carrying a
small bag in one hand and his cap in the other.
</p>

<p>
"I think we may as well make a start," continued
Tony.  "Don't hurry yourself, 'Tiger.'  Just paddle
along comfortably, and whatever you do keep your
eyes off the opposite side of the road.  You can
either take the bag back to Goodman's Rest, or else
leave it in the bar at the Castle.  Anyhow meet me
in a quarter of an hour's time in the back garden of
the Hollies."
</p>

<p>
Bugg nodded his head.  "I'll be there, Sir Ant'ny,"
he replied grimly.
</p>

<p>
Tony pushed open the door of the sitting-room.
"We had better wait in here, Isabel," he said.  "We
mustn't be seen conspiring together in the hall when
Bugg goes out, or it might put the enemy on his
guard."
</p>

<p>
A few seconds later the peace of Latimer Lane was
suddenly disturbed by the banging of Mrs. Spalding's
front door.  Whistling a bright little music hall
ditty to himself, Bugg came marching down the
garden path and passed out through the gate into the
roadway.  He paused for a moment to extract and
light himself a Woodbine cigarette, and then, without
looking back at the house, set off at a leisurely
pace in the direction of the Heath.
</p>

<p>
For ten minutes a deep unbroken hush brooded
over the neighbourhood.  If there were any human
beings about they still remained silent and invisible,
while the solitary cat, who had glanced up resentfully
as Bugg passed, gradually resumed her former
attitude of somnolent repose.
</p>

<p>
Then once more the door of number sixteen opened,
and Tony and Isabel made their appearance.  The
latter was wearing no hat, and her red-gold hair
gleamed in the sunshine, like copper in the firelight.
They strolled down together as far as the gate, where
they remained for a few moments laughing and
chatting.  Then, with a final and fairly audible
observation to the effect that he would be back about
six, Tony took his departure.  He went off to the
left, in the opposite direction from that patronized
by Bugg.
</p>

<p>
Turning lightly round Isabel sauntered back up
the garden.  The front door closed behind her, and
once again peace&mdash;the well ordered peace of a
superior London suburb, descended upon Latimer Lane.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
At the back of the house Mrs. Spalding was
standing at the kitchen window, which she had
pushed up to its fullest extent.  Her eyes were fixed
anxiously upon the summit of the wall which divided
her miniature back yard from the adjoining property.
It was a venerable wall, of early Victorian
origin, about twelve feet in height, and thickly
covered with a mat of ivy.
</p>

<p>
At last, from the other side came a faint rustle,
followed almost immediately by the unmistakable
scrape and scuffle of somebody attempting an ascent.
Then a hand and arm appeared over the top, and
a moment later Bugg had hoisted himself into
view, and was sitting astride the parapet.  He
paused for an instant to whisper back some hoarse
but inaudible remark, and then catching hold of
the ivy swung himself neatly and rapidly to the
ground.
</p>

<p>
There was another and rather louder scuffle, and
Tony followed suit.  He came down into the yard
even quicker than Bugg&mdash;his descent being somewhat
accelerated by the behaviour of a branch of ivy,
which detached itself from the wall, just as he had
got his full weight on it.
</p>

<p>
"Yer ain't 'urt yerself, 'ave ye, sir?" inquired
the faithful "Tiger" with some anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head, and discarded the handful of
foliage that he was still clutching.
</p>

<p>
"One should never trust entirely to Nature,
Bugg," he observed.  "She invariably lets one
down."
</p>

<p>
He stopped to flick off the dust and cobwebs from
the knees of his trousers, and then leading the way
across the yard to the kitchen window, he scrambled
in over the sill.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I have thinned out your ivy a bit,
Mrs. Spalding," he remarked regretfully.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter the least about that, sir,"
replied Mrs. Spalding, "so long as you haven't gone and
shook yourself up."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I have," said Tony.  "I feel
extraordinarily well except for a slight craving for
tea."  He paused.  "No sign of the enemy yet, I
suppose?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Spalding shook her head.  "It's all been
quite quiet so far, Sir Antony."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think we had better go upstairs and
arrange our plans," he observed.  "We may have
plenty of time, but it's just as well to be on the safe
side.  There's a strain of impetuosity in the foreign
blood that one has to look out for."
</p>

<p>
He moved towards the door; and followed by
Mrs. Spalding and Bugg&mdash;the latter of whom had climbed
in through the window after him&mdash;he mounted the
flight of stone stairs that led up into the hall.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose Miss Francis is in her bedroom?" he
said turning to Mrs. Spalding.
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head.  "Yes, Sir Antony.  She
went up directly she came back into the house."
</p>

<p>
He took a step forward and stood for a moment
contemplating the scene with the thoughtful air of a
general surveying the site of a future battle.
</p>

<p>
"I think your place, Bugg," he said, "will be half-way
up the staircase, just out of sight of the front
door.  I shall wait in the sitting-room, and
Mrs. Spalding will be downstairs in the kitchen."  He
paused.  "What will happen is this.  When the bell
rings Mrs. Spalding will come up and open the door.
Directly she does, our friends will probably force their
way into the hall and ask to see Miss Francis.  They
will know she is upstairs, because as a matter of fact
she is sitting in the window reading a book."
</p>

<p>
"Am I to let them through, sir?" inquired Mrs.
Spalding.
</p>

<p>
"Not without a protest," said Tony; "but I expect
as a matter of fact they will simply push past you.
People like that have very bad manners, especially
when they are pressed for time.  In that case all you
have got to do will be to fall back to the kitchen stairs
and leave the rest to us."
</p>

<p>
Bugg sighed happily.  "An' then I s'pose I comes
dahn and we shoves it across 'em, sir?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"That's the idea," said Tony, "but there's no need
to be rough or unkind about it.  All I want to do
is to get them into the sitting-room in a sufficiently
chastened frame of mind to answer a few civil
questions.  It oughtn't to be difficult unless they have
got revolvers."
</p>

<p>
"Revolvers!" repeated Mrs. Spalding in some
distress.  "Oh, dear, dear!  You will be careful,
won't you, Sir Antony?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall," said Tony: "extremely careful."
</p>

<p>
He walked to the hall table and picked up the
blackthorn that he had left lying there.  "I don't
think I shall want this," he remarked, "but
perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off abruptly, as a faint sound from
outside suddenly reached his ear.
</p>

<p>
"Listen!" he said softly.  "What's that?"
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's pause, and then quite clearly
came the unmistakable click of the front gate.
</p>

<p>
Swiftly and quietly Tony stepped back to the
sitting-room door.
</p>

<p>
"Here they are!" he announced with a cheerful
smile.  "Take it coolly: there's heaps of time."
</p>

<p>
Considering the abrupt nature of the crisis, it must
be admitted that both Mrs. Spalding and Bugg rose
to the occasion in the most creditable fashion.  In
three strides the latter had disappeared up the staircase,
while if Mrs. Spalding was a shade less precipitous,
it was only because she was not so well fitted by
nature for sudden and violent transitions.
</p>

<p>
Tony waited until they were both out of sight, and
then with a final glance round the hall he stepped
back into the sitting-room.  He closed the door
after him until only the faintest crack was visible
from outside, and having placed his blackthorn
carefully in the corner, he stood there in easy
readiness, his hand resting lightly on the door knob.
</p>

<p>
For perhaps thirty seconds the steady ticking of the
hall clock alone broke the silence.  Then the sound
of a slight movement became suddenly audible outside
the house, and a moment later the sharp <i>tang,
tang</i> of a bell went jangling through the basement.
With a contented smile Tony began to button up
his coat.
</p>

<p>
He heard Mrs. Spalding mount the stairs and pass
along the hall passage outside.  There was the sharp
snap of a bolt being pushed back, and then almost
simultaneously came a sudden scuffle of footsteps,
and the loud bang of an abruptly closed door.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon, Madame," said a voice.  "We do not
wish to alarm you, but it is necessary that we speak
with the young lady upstairs."
</p>

<p>
For a complete amateur in private theatricals,
Mrs. Spalding played her part admirably.
</p>

<p>
"You will do nothing of the kind," she replied
with every symptom of surprised indignation.  "Who
are you?  How dare you force your way into a
private house like this?"
</p>

<p>
"You will pardon us, Madame," repeated the
voice, "but I fear we must insist.  We mean no
harm to the young lady: on the contrary we are her
best&mdash;her truest friends."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Spalding sniffed audibly.  "That's as it may
be," she retorted.  "Anyhow, you don't set a foot
on my staircase; and what's more, if you don't leave
the house immediately I shall send for the police."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief whispered consultation in what
sounded like a foreign language, and then the same
voice spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"We dislike to use force, Madame; but since you
leave us no choice&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Once more came the quick shuffle of steps, followed
in this case by the crash of an overturning chair,
and then with a swift jerk Tony flung open the door,
and strode blithely out into the hall.  He took in the
situation at a glance.  True to her instructions
Mrs. Spalding had retreated to the head of the kitchen
banisters, where one of the intruders had followed
as though to cut her off from further interference.
The other was bounding gaily up the staircase,
apparently under the happy impression that the road
was now clear before him.
</p>

<p>
Tony just had time to see that the man in the
hall was the shorter of the two, when with an
exclamation of anger and alarm that gentleman spun
round to meet him.  As he turned his right hand
travelled swiftly back towards his hip pocket, but
the action though well intended was too late to
be effective.  With one tiger-like spring Tony had
crossed the intervening distance, and clutching him
affectionately round the waist, had pinned his arms
to his sides.
</p>

<p>
"No shooting, Harold," he said.  "You might
break the pictures."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the whole staircase was suddenly
shaken by a crash upstairs, followed by the heavy
thud of a falling body.  Then, almost simultaneously,
the head of "Tiger" Bugg protruded itself over the
banisters.
</p>

<p>
"All right below, sir?" it inquired with some
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Tony looked up.  "If you have quite finished,
you might come down and take away this revolver,"
he replied tranquilly.
</p>

<p>
That Bugg had finished was evident from the
immediate nature of his response.  He leaped down
the stairs with the activity of a chamois, and darting
in behind Tony's struggling captive, fished out a
wicked looking Mauser pistol from that gentleman's
hip pocket.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere we are, sir," he announced cheerfully.
"Loaded up proper too from the look of it."
</p>

<p>
Tony released his grip, and the owner of the
weapon staggered back against the wall gasping
like a newly landed fish.
</p>

<p>
"Give it to me," said Tony holding out his hand,
and as Bugg complied, he added in that pleasantly
lazy way of his: "If you haven't corpsed the gentleman
upstairs, go and bring him down into the
sitting-room."  Then, turning to his own late adversary, he
observed hospitably: "Perhaps you wouldn't mind
joining us, sir.  I am sure we shall all enjoy a little
chat."
</p>

<p>
The stranger, who was gradually beginning to
recover from Tony's bear-like hug, scowled horribly.
He was not a prepossessing looking person, for in
addition to a cast in his left eye, his swarthy and
truculent face was further disfigured by the scar of an
old sword cut, which seemed to have just failed in a
laudable effort to slice off the greater part of his jaw.
All the same there was a certain air of force and
authority about him, which redeemed him from
absolute ruffianism.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the scowl, however, he made no further
protest, but followed by Tony and the Mauser,
marched along into the sitting-room, where he folded
his arms and took up a defiant posture on the hearth-rug.
</p>

<p>
There was a sound of banging and bumping from
the staircase, and a moment later Bugg entered
through the doorway, half carrying and half pushing
the semi-conscious figure of the other invader.
</p>

<p>
"I 'it 'im a bit 'arder than I meant to, sir," he
explained apologetically to Tony; "but 'e's comin'
rahnd now nice an' pretty."
</p>

<p>
He deposited the convalescent carefully in the
easy-chair, and then stepped back as though waiting
further instructions.
</p>

<p>
It was the cross-eyed gentleman, however, who
broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
"In my country," he observed thickly, "you
would die for this&mdash;both of you."
</p>

<p>
Tony smiled at him indulgently.  "I am sure we
should," he said; "but that's the best of Hampstead;
it's so devilish healthy."  He paused.  "Won't
you sit down and make yourself comfortable?" he
added.
</p>

<p>
There was something so unexpected either about
the request or else the manner of it, that for a moment
the visitor seemed at a loss what to do.  At length,
however, he seated himself on the edge of the sofa,
still glowering savagely at Tony with his working
eye.
</p>

<p>
It was at this point that his friend in the chair
began to emerge into something like intelligent
interest in the proceedings.  After blinking vaguely
and shaking his head once or twice, he suddenly
raised himself in his seat, and looked round him
with a slightly bewildered air.  His gaze finally
came to rest on the barrel of the Mauser pistol which
happened at the moment to be pointing in his direction.

His gaze finally came to rest on the barrel of the Mauser pistol.  
&quot;Feeling better?&quot; inquired Tony kindly.  An obvious 
train of recollection flashed across the stranger's face.  
&quot;I remember now,&quot; he muttered.  &quot;Something struck 
me&mdash;something on the stairs.&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Feeling better?" inquired Tony kindly.
</p>

<p>
An obvious train of recollection flashed across the
stranger's face, and with an instinctive movement he
raised his hand to his jaw.
</p>

<p>
"I remember now," he muttered.  "Something
struck me.  Something on the stairs."
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said Tony encouragingly.  "It
was Bugg's fist.  Very few people can take a punch
in the jaw from Bugg and remember the exact details."
</p>

<p>
The stranger looked at Tony with some curiosity.
He had a more refined and intelligent face than
his companion, while from the few words he had
spoken his foreign accent appeared to be less
pronounced.
</p>

<p>
"I presume," he said, "that I am addressing Sir
Antony Conway?"
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "You at least have the advantage
of knowing whom you're talking to."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's pause, and then the man on
the sofa laughed aggressively.
</p>

<p>
"It is an advantage that you possibly share with
us," he growled.
</p>

<p>
Tony turned on him.  "Except for the fact that you
appear to belong to the criminal classes," he said,
"I haven't the foggiest notion who either of you are."
</p>

<p>
With what sounded distressingly like an oath the
cross-eyed gentleman scrambled to his feet, but a
slight change in the direction of the Mauser pulled
him up abruptly.
</p>

<p>
It was his friend who relieved the somewhat
strained situation.
</p>

<p>
"You forget, Colonel," he said suavely.  "If Sir
Antony Conway is not aware who we are, our conduct
must certainly appear to be a trifle peculiar."  He
turned back to Tony.  "If you would grant us the
privilege of a few moments' private conversation I
fancy we might come to a better understanding.  It
is possible that we are rather&mdash;how do you say&mdash;at
cross purposes."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't wonder," replied Tony cheerfully.
"Do you mind going out into the hall for a minute,
Bugg?  I am sorry to leave you out of it, but one
must respect the wishes of one's guests."
</p>

<p>
It was the first occasion on which Bugg had ever
received an order from Tony that he had hesitated
over the immediate fulfilment.
</p>

<p>
"It ain't as I want to 'ear wot they says, sir,"
he explained apologetically.  "It's leavin' you alone
with the blighters I don't like."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't be alone, 'Tiger,'" said Tony.  "I shall
have this excellent little Mauser pistol to keep me
company."
</p>

<p>
Bugg walked reluctantly to the door.  "I'll only
be just in the 'all if you want me," he observed.
"You'll watch aht for any dirty work, won't ye, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall," said Tony: "most intently."
</p>

<p>
He waited until the door had closed, and then
seated himself on the corner of the table, with the
Mauser dangling between his knees.
</p>

<p>
"Well, gentlemen?" he observed encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Antony Conway," said the taller of the two.
"Will you permit me to ask you a perfectly frank
question?  Are you aware of the identity of this
young lady, in whose behalf you seem to have
interested yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
"And may we take it that in coming as you
thought to her assistance you acted from&mdash;" he
paused&mdash;"from entirely private motives?"  He
waited for the answer with an eagerness that was
plainly visible.
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "I never act from anything else,"
he remarked.
</p>

<p>
The tall man turned to his companion.  "It is as
I suggested, Colonel," he observed, with an air of
quiet triumph.
</p>

<p>
The other still glared suspiciously at Tony.
"Have a care," he muttered.  "Who knows that
he is speaking the truth."
</p>

<p>
The tall man made a gesture of impatience.  "You
do not understand the English nobility, Colonel."  He
turned back to Tony.  "Permit us to introduce
ourselves.  This is Colonel Saltero of the Livadian
army.  My name is Congosta&mdash;Señor Eduardo
Congosta.  It is a name not unknown among Livadian
Loyalists."
</p>

<p>
Tony bowed bravely to the pair of them.  "I am
delighted to meet you both," he said.  "I can't
profess any great admiration for your distinguished
monarch, but perhaps I don't know his finer qualities."
</p>

<p>
"Our distinguished monarch," repeated the Colonel
darkly.  "Of whom do you speak, Sir Antony?"
</p>

<p>
Tony raised his eyebrows.  "Why&mdash;Peter of
course," he said.  "Pedro, I should say.  Have you
more than one of them?"
</p>

<p>
Colonel Saltero, who was still upon his feet, scowled
more savagely than ever.  "That miserable
impostor," he exclaimed.  "I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You misunderstand us, sir," put in the smoother
voice of Señor Congosta.  "The person you refer to
has no legitimate claim to the throne of Livadia.
Like all true Loyalists we are followers of his late
Majesty King Francisco the First."
</p>

<p>
It was a startling announcement, but Tony's
natural composure stood him in good stead.
</p>

<p>
"Really!" he said slowly.  "How extremely
interesting!  I thought you had all been exterminated."
</p>

<p>
Señor Congosta smiled.  "You will pardon my
saying so, Sir Antony, but an accurate knowledge of
Continental affairs is not one of your great nation's
strong points."  He paused.  "Our party is more
powerful now than at any time during the last
fifteen years."
</p>

<p>
"But how about the government?" said Tony.
"Surely they don't look on you any more affectionately
than on Pedro and his little lot?"
</p>

<p>
"The government!"  Señor Congosta repeated the
words with the utmost scorn.  "I will be frank with
you, Sir Antony.  The Republican government is
doomed.  Too long has that collection of traitors
battened on my unfortunate country.  It needs
but one spark to kindle the flame, and&mdash;"  With a
sweep of his arm he indicated the painful and abrupt
fate that was awaiting the President of Livadia and
his advisers.
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Tony slowly.  "Then your somewhat
original method of calling is connected with
State affairs?"
</p>

<p>
Señor Congosta spread out his hands.  "There is
no point in further concealment," he observed.  "I
think you will agree with me, Colonel Saltero, that
we had better tell this gentleman the entire truth."
</p>

<p>
That Colonel grunted doubtfully, as though telling
the entire truth were not a habit that he was
accustomed to approve of, but the reply, such as it was,
seemed good enough for his companion.
</p>

<p>
"For some time past," he said, "the Loyalists of
Livadia have only been waiting their opportunity.
The Republic is rotten&mdash;rotten to the core.  It must
soon fall like a bad fruit, and then&mdash;" he paused&mdash;"then
will come the chance for which we are ready."
</p>

<p>
"And for which," added Tony, "the Marquis da
Freitas is also eminently ready."
</p>

<p>
Congosta's eyes gleamed.  "So!" he said softly.
"You know him?"
</p>

<p>
"Not intimately," said Tony: "just well enough
to know that he is likely to be around when the prizes
are given out."
</p>

<p>
Congosta nodded his head.  A malevolent expression
had crept into his face that made him look
almost as sinister as the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
"It is with Da Freitas," he said slowly, "that we
have to settle.  With Da Freitas and one other.
Until a month ago everything had been arranged for.
We knew that here in England the usurper was
plotting and planning for his restoration.  We knew
that he had many friends in the army and navy&mdash;that
any moment the revolution might break out.
But we were prepared.  The very moment trouble
came we intended to strike&mdash;and strike hard."
</p>

<p>
He stopped.
</p>

<p>
"What were you going to do?" asked Tony with
interest.
</p>

<p>
"We should have seized the Palace before Da
Freitas' hirelings and traitors were ready, and
proclaimed Francisco's daughter as the rightful heir
to the throne."
</p>

<p>
There was another pause.
</p>

<p>
"It was a good idea," said Tony; "but I gather
there has been a slight hitch somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"We were betrayed," said Congosta sullenly.
"We made the mistake of trusting to a coward and a
fool.  It is the price that one always pays for such
mistakes."
</p>

<p>
"Who was the gentleman?" asked Tony innocently.
</p>

<p>
"It was the King's brother-in-law&mdash;the Count de
Sé.  He was left guardian to the Princess Isabella
under his late Majesty's will.  All along he has
pretended to work with us; and then, a month ago,
he came secretly to England and betrayed the whole
of our purpose to Da Freitas."
</p>

<p>
There was a sulphurous snort from Colonel Saltero,
as though the mere mention of the incident were
altogether too much for his feelings.
</p>

<p>
"We should be thankful," went on Congosta
bitterly, "that the Princess is still alive.  Da
Freitas is not particular when his own interests are at
stake.  Had it suited him&mdash;" he made an expressive
gesture with his hands.  "As it is he seems to have
thought the Count's plan equally effective&mdash;and
perhaps healthier for himself.  Why should not
Pedro marry the Princess?  Then when the revolution
came there would only be one claimant to the
throne of Livadia, and all our plans would be flung
to the ground."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me," said Tony thoughtfully, "that
the Count de Sé is what we call a dirty dog in
this country.  All the same I don't quite see what
he was driving at.  Surely it would have suited
his book better for Isabella to be queen in her own
right."
</p>

<p>
"He was afraid," said Congosta scornfully.  "He
is a coward, and he was afraid there would be fighting,
and perhaps failure.  He has no heart for such
things.  It seemed to him better to live under the
shelter of Da Freitas."
</p>

<p>
"He will not live long," growled the Colonel
ominously.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as we learned what had happened,"
continued Congosta, "we had a council at Portriga,
and it was decided that the Colonel and I should
come to England.  We have friends and agents here
and it was not difficult to find out where the Count
was living.  I took a room at Richmond, and for a
week I watched and waited in the hope of speaking
with the Princess.  I was convinced that she knew
nothing of what was happening in Livadia&mdash;that she
probably believed her father's friends were dead or
powerless.  The first day I discovered she was there,
but as for speaking with her&mdash;" he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"there was an old hag of a French woman
who never left her&mdash;who watched her like a cat.
Then at last came the evening when she left the
house&mdash;alone.  At first I was on my guard; I feared
that Da Freitas might have learned I was in Richmond;
that he was using this means to draw me into
a trap.  It was only when she got to the station and
hid in the waiting-room that I began to suspect she
was running away.  I did not speak with her then; I
did not wish to alarm her.  I knew she was going
to Waterloo, because I had listened when she asked
for her ticket.  So while I waited I sent off a
telegram to Saltero to meet me there, and I too came up
to London in the same train."
</p>

<p>
He paused again, half out of breath from the
rapidity with which he had been speaking.
</p>

<p>
"I think I have a good working idea of the rest of
the story," said Tony.  He slipped off the table
and stood up facing his two prisoners.  "I owe you
an apology," he added, "both of you.  I am afraid
that in our anxiety to assist the Princess, Bugg and
I have been rather unnecessarily strenuous."
</p>

<p>
Congosta rose to his feet and bowed gravely.
"Sir Antony Conway," he said.  "You behaved as I
should expect an English nobleman to behave under
the circumstances.  Neither Colonel Saltero nor
myself bear you any ill will for the slight
inconvenience we have suffered."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel, who seemed to be a man of less
expansive habit, grunted again, but Tony did not
allow this apparent lack of enthusiasm to damp the
graciousness of Congosta's speech.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," he said, "you have been frank
with me, and I will be equally frank with you.
When I came to the assistance of Princess Isabella,
I had not the remotest notion who she was.  I acted
on the impulse of the moment, as I suppose any one
else would have acted.  Out of gratitude for this
very slight service, the Princess was good enough to
take me into her confidence.  When I found that
she was being forced into a marriage for which she
had the strongest possible dislike, I naturally
determined to put a stop to it.  I have my own reasons
for not regarding Pedro as a suitable husband for her,
apart altogether from the fact that she hates the
sight of him.  If it will relieve your minds in any way
I can assure you that she will be quite safe from him
as long as she will do me the honour of accepting my
assistance."
</p>

<p>
It was the Colonel's turn to answer.  "That is
well," he said.  "We are obliged to you for what
you have done, but the affair cannot remain so.
We must speak with the Princess.  She must be
informed of the high destiny that awaits her."
</p>

<p>
"That is a point," said Tony politely, "on which I
am not quite in agreement with you, Colonel.  The
Princess has placed herself under my guardianship
and I should be neglecting my duty if I encouraged
her to mix herself up with an attempted revolution.
I consider it a very unhealthy profession for a girl of
her age."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel glared at him.  "Sir!" he stammered.
"Do you dare to thrust yourself in between the
throne of Livadia and its Divinely appointed occupant?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," said Tony cheerfully; "I don't go as far
as that.  When you have managed to make the
throne vacant, I shall be very pleased to advise the
Princess to step into it.  Until then she is much
happier and safer in Hampstead."
</p>

<p>
"I am inclined to think that Sir Antony Conway
may be right, Colonel," broke in the voice of Señor
Congosta.  "The Princess's welfare must be our
first consideration.  To take her to Livadia at
present is out of the question, and I don't know any
place where she would be safer from Da Freitas than
in this house.  We have had personal proof of the
excellence of Sir Antony's arrangements.  As for
her being identified in any way with our plans&mdash;" he
paused&mdash;"well, the Republican government has been
recognized by England, and it would be madness
on our part to give them any avoidable cause for
complaint."
</p>

<p>
There was still a doubtful frown upon the Colonel's
brow.
</p>

<p>
"I do not approve of the situation," he said stiffly.
"It is not fitting that the future Queen of Livadia
should be living in this house&mdash;unchaperoned and
unprotected."
</p>

<p>
With a solemn face Tony drew himself up to his full
height.
</p>

<p>
"Sir!" he said.  "You forget that you are addressing
a member of the English nobility."
</p>

<p>
The magnificence of the retort seemed to have a
temporarily paralysing effect upon the Colonel, and
before he could recover Señor Congosta, who was
evidently the directing brain of the two, had taken
the matter into his own hands.
</p>

<p>
"It is well spoken," he said with another low bow.
"Sir Antony Conway&mdash;on behalf of my country,
permit me to express the confidence and gratitude
with which we accept your assistance."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
MOLLY BECOMES AN ALLY
</h3>

<p>
Guy sat in his chair, and for a moment surveyed
the admirably kept garden of Goodman's Rest with a
thoughtful frown.  Then his gaze travelled back to
Tony and Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"We are in an extraordinary situation," he
observed slowly.
</p>

<p>
It was just at half-past ten in the morning, and
they were all of them sitting on the lawn at the back
of the house, in a pleasant blaze of spring sunshine
which streamed down out of a cloudless blue sky.
Tony, who was smoking a cigar, had just finished
giving his cousin a full and spirited description of
his interview with Congosta and Saltero, for by the
time he had returned to the house on the previous
evening, Guy, who had been suffering from a slight
headache, had already gone to bed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see anything so very extraordinary about
it," said Tony placidly.  "Everybody seems to me
to be behaving in a most natural and reasonable
manner.  In fact I am just a bit disappointed.  I
always thought that people who went in for
revolutions and that kind of thing were much more
mysterious and exciting."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know what you want!" retorted
Guy.  "You appear to have got both the Royalists
and the Franciscans on your track, and as far as
sticking at trifles goes, I shouldn't imagine there
was much to choose between any of the parties in
Livadia."
</p>

<p>
"You must remember that you are speaking of
Isabel's native land," protested Tony reprovingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he can say what he likes about Livadia,"
said Isabel.  "It's all true."
</p>

<p>
"And anyhow," went on Guy, "if we mean to get
out of this business safely and successfully we must
look at things exactly as they are and not as they
ought to be.  As far as I can see the whole affair
is more like a cheap melodrama than anything else,
but that doesn't mean there isn't a very real danger
for people who choose to mix themselves up in it."  He
paused.  "What was your final understanding
with these&mdash;these people?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we parted the best of friends," said Tony
cheerfully.  "At least Congosta and I did.  The
Colonel was a little bit stuffy at not being allowed to
see Isabel, but I put that down to his military training.
A good soldier never likes to be baulked in his
object."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes; but what are they going to do?"
persisted Guy.  "You must have come to some sort of
an arrangement."
</p>

<p>
"We came to a very good arrangement," said
Tony.  "I am to continue looking after Isabel and
keeping her away from the fascinations of Peter,
while they go on with the job of getting the throne
ready for her.  The Colonel is on his way back to
Livadia already."
</p>

<p>
"And what about the other man&mdash;Congosta?"
</p>

<p>
"Congosta is staying on in England for the present.
I have got his address at Richmond.  He says it's
necessary that someone should be here in order to
keep an eye on Peter and Da Freitas.  I don't
suppose he altogether trusts me either."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay he doesn't," observed Guy drily.
</p>

<p>
"He probably agreed to the arrangement because
he hadn't any immediate choice in the matter.  I
shouldn't imagine that we could depend on him in
the least."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Tony.  "He seems to have
a great faith in the virtue and nobility of the English
aristocracy.  I think he must be a reader of Charles
Garvice."
</p>

<p>
"Have you made any plans yourself?" asked Guy.
</p>

<p>
Tony took a thoughtful pull at his cigar.  "Well,
I have got one or two ideas that I was talking over
with Isabel last night.  In the first place I think I
shall tell Aunt Fanny all about it.  It's just the sort
of thing that would appeal to her thoroughly; and
then she would be an excellent chaperone if we
happened to want one."
</p>

<p>
Guy pondered over the suggestion for a moment.
"I think you are right," he admitted half
reluctantly.  "We certainly ought to have someone
for&mdash;for Isabel's sake," (it was the first time he had
dropped the more formal Miss Francis) "and I
suppose Aunt Fanny is the only possible person.
All the same the fewer people who know anything
about it the better."
</p>

<p>
"I don't propose to tell any one else," said Tony,
"except Molly.  Oh, it's all right," he added, as
Guy directed an embarrassed glance towards their
companion; "I told Isabel all about Molly last night.
She has survived the shock splendidly."
</p>

<p>
"I am not a child, Cousin Guy," said Isabel with
dignity.
</p>

<p>
"But is it necessary to bring this&mdash;this young
woman in?" objected Guy.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is," said Tony, "and I wish you
wouldn't refer to her in that dreadful way.  It
sounds as if she wore black cotton gloves.  Molly's
our Chief Intelligence Department.  It's only
through her that we can get any idea of what's
going on at Richmond, and apart from that she is
the best friend we could possibly have.  She regards
Peter as her private property&mdash;a poor thing, but her
own&mdash;and she doesn't mean to lose him without a
good scrap.  She's got grit and nerve, Molly has;
otherwise she wouldn't be playing lead at the
Gaiety."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Guy resignedly.  "I suppose
that if one goes in for this sort of thing one must get
help where one can.  When do you propose to see
her?"
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Tony; "if she's out of bed.  I am
going to motor down there right away."  He got up
from his chair.  "You will be careful while I am
away, won't you, Isabel?" he added.  "Bugg is on
duty all right, but I think it would be safer for you
to stop in the garden unless you want to go back to
the house.  One doesn't know what Da Freitas may
be up to."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel will be quite safe," said Guy with some
spirit.  "I will remain with her myself if she will
allow me to."
</p>

<p>
"That will be very nice," said Isabel graciously.
</p>

<p>
Tony tossed away the stump of his cigar.  "I
believe that Guy will end by being the most reckless
adventurer of the lot of us," he said gravely.  "It's
generally the way when people take up a fresh hobby
late in life."
</p>

<p>
Isabel gave one of her little rippling laughs, and
before Guy could think of an adequate retort, Tony
had sauntered off up the path in the direction of the
garage.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the hobbies of Miss Molly Monk that of
early rising&mdash;as Tony knew&mdash;occupied a comparatively
modest place, and he was accordingly not
surprised on reaching her flat to learn from Claudine,
the French maid, that her mistress was still in bed.
</p>

<p>
"Is she awake?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mais oui, M'sieur</i>," replied Claudine.  "She
'ave 'er morning chocolate.  I just take it in to
'er."
</p>

<p>
"Well, will you go and give her my love," said
Tony, "and tell her I should like to see her as soon
as it could be happily managed."
</p>

<p>
Claudine conducted Tony to the little drawing-room,
and then tripped demurely away down the
passage to deliver her message.  She was not
absent for long, as thirty seconds could hardly have
elapsed before she re-entered the apartment.
</p>

<p>
"If M'sieur will follow me," she announced.
"Madem'selle will receive him."
</p>

<p>
She led the way to Molly's bedroom, and pushing
open the door which was already ajar, ushered Tony
into a charming atmosphere of cream walls, apple
green hangings, and a huge brass bedstead.
</p>

<p>
In the bedstead was Molly.  She was sitting up
against a little mountain of white pillows, with a
Japanese kimona thrown lightly round her gossamer
nightdress, and her red hair streaming loose over her
shoulders.  She was sipping chocolate, and looked
very cool and attractive.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Tony," she said.  "I hope you don't
mind being received in this shameless fashion.  It's
your own fault you know for coming so early."
</p>

<p>
She extended a slim white hand and wrist, and
Tony having implanted a kiss on the latter, seated
himself comfortably on the end of the bed.
</p>

<p>
"I am not seriously annoyed, Molly," he replied.
"I find that my naturally Calvinistic principles are
becoming broader as I get older."  He looked at
her with an approving glance.  "Besides," he went
on, "at one time it was all the fashion to receive
distinguished visitors in bed.  Madame du Barry&mdash;a
very highly connected French lady&mdash;made a hobby
of it."
</p>

<p>
"Did she&mdash;the saucy puss!" said Molly.  She
pushed across a tortoise shell cigarette case that was
lying on the silk coverlet in front of her.  "You can
light up if you like," she added.  "I am going to
have one myself in a minute."
</p>

<p>
Tony took advantage of her permission, and
leaning back against the brass rail blew out a little
spiral of grey smoke.
</p>

<p>
"I came at this indelicate hour," he observed,
"because I promised I would look round directly I
had anything to tell you."
</p>

<p>
Molly sat up in bed.  "Oh," she exclaimed eagerly,
"have you heard from that friend of yours&mdash;the one
in Portriga?"
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head. "Not yet; there hasn't
been time."  He paused.  "I don't know that it's
altogether necessary to go to Portriga for news
though.  One seems to be able to pick up a certain
amount of Livadian gossip in London."
</p>

<p>
Molly put down her cup of chocolate on the tray
beside her.  "Tony," she said, "what have you
heard?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a long and poignant story," said Tony.
"Are you in any hurry to get up?"
</p>

<p>
"Do I look like it?"  She reached across the bed
for the cigarette case.  "Wait a moment till I've
got a light; then I shan't interrupt you."
</p>

<p>
She struck a match, and drawing in a mouthful of
smoke, leaned back against the pillows.
</p>

<p>
"That's better," she observed contentedly.  "Now
fire ahead."
</p>

<p>
The art of telling a long story well is a regrettably
rare one, especially amongst people who are chiefly
addicted to the habit.  Tony, however, undoubtedly
possessed it to a certain extent, and in the present
case he enjoyed the additional advantage of having
already practised upon Guy.  Starting from his
meeting with Isabel in Long Acre, he recounted in
that pleasantly unhurried fashion of his the whole of
the spirited events which had led up to his present
visit.  He concealed nothing&mdash;not even his deception
of Isabel in connection with the pawning of her
brooch, for if Molly was to be accepted as an active
ally, it was obviously necessary that there should be
no half measures about the matter.  Besides, Tony,
who preferred his own judgment to any one else's,
considered Molly to be one of the most trustworthy
people he had ever met.
</p>

<p>
She was at all events an irreproachable listener.
Lying back against the pillows, her hands clasped
behind her head, she followed his narrative with
an absorbed interest that showed itself plainly
in her eyes.  She made no attempt to interrupt
him or to ask questions&mdash;indeed with the
exception of occasionally knocking off the ash of
her cigarette into the breakfast tray, she
remained as motionless and silent as a Kirchner
picture.
</p>

<p>
"And that," observed Tony in conclusion, "is as
far as we've got to at present.  At least it's all I
know for certain.  Of course I may get back to find
that Guy and Isabel have been murdered in the
garden."  He rose from the bed, and crossing to the
fireplace tossed away the stump of his cigarette,
which he had allowed to go out.  "Well, what do
you say, Molly?" he added cheerfully.  "Are you
prepared to come in with us, and do your bit in
saving Peter from bigamy?"
</p>

<p>
Molly sat up in bed, her blue eyes gleaming with a
brisk and businesslike determination.
</p>

<p>
"I should think I was," she observed crisply.
"If any one imagines I've taken all the trouble of
training and educating Peter for nothing, they're
making a fat mistake."  She shook back her hair
with a resolute gesture that spoke volumes for her
sincerity.  "Tony," she said, "you're a brick.  I
really don't know how to thank you."
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing to thank me for," said Tony.
"I have taken up the case in the interests of
European morals.  I don't approve of a young man
marrying, when he already has a wife in the sight
of Heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Not only in the sight of Heaven," returned
Molly with spirit.  "In the sight of the Registrar of
Chelmsford as well."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief pause.  "Good Lord!" said
Tony slowly.  "Is that a fact?"
</p>

<p>
Molly half jumped up in bed, and then sitting
down again, pulled up the counterpane.
</p>

<p>
"I can't get out," she said, "this nightdress isn't
respectable.  Just go to the dressing-table,
Tony&mdash;there's a dear&mdash;and open that top drawer on the right.
You'll find a jewel-case inside&mdash;a brown one."
</p>

<p>
Tony did as he was commanded, and took out a
small Russia leather box, with Molly's initials in
gold stamped upon the lid.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are," she said, holding out her hand.
"Now give me that little bunch of keys by the brush."
</p>

<p>
She opened the box, and rummaging inside
extracted a slip of paper, which she unfolded and
glanced through before handing it to Tony.
</p>

<p>
"How about that?" she inquired with a sort of
dispassionate triumph.
</p>

<p>
Tony took the document, and sitting down again
on the foot of the bed, spread it out in front of him.
It was the ordinary registrar's form of marriage
certificate, dated at Chelmsford six months previously,
and it set out in the restrained but convincing
style adopted by such authors, that on the date in
question Mary Monk, daughter of John Monk,
game-keeper, and Pedro da Talles, son of Pedro da
Talles, gentleman, had seen fit to enter into the
bonds of Holy Matrimony.
</p>

<p>
Tony read it through with an interest that he
seldom devoted to current literature, and then
looked up with an expression of deep admiration.
</p>

<p>
"You're a wonderful person, Molly," he said.
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders.  "Oh, I'm not under
any mistaken ideas about its value," she replied
coolly.  "I know it wouldn't cut any ice in Livadia&mdash;and
I expect it's about equally useless here.  You see
in the first place Pedro isn't allowed to marry any one
except a Royalty, and then of course this paper's all
out of order.  You see we had to keep it dark who
Peter really was, or of course the news would have
been all over the shop.  Fortunately no ordinary
person in England knows his family name, so there
wasn't much chance of anybody spotting the entry.
The only thing was we couldn't describe his father
as a king&mdash;that would have busted the show
hopelessly&mdash;so we had to put him down as a gentleman.
I expect that's enough to make it illegal by itself."
</p>

<p>
"I should think so," said Tony.  "It's certainly
a very misleading description, judging by popular
rumour."  He paused.  "What made you do it,
Molly, and how did you manage to bring it off?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was easy enough," replied Molly a little
contemptuously.  "I believe I could make Peter do
almost anything.  He's frightfully fond of me in his
way."  She leaned forward and picked up the paper.
"I don't really know why I bothered about it," she
added thoughtfully.  "I think it was partly just to
show myself I could, and partly&mdash;" she stopped and
laughed&mdash;"well, Granddad used to be a churchwarden
at Helbeck, you know, and right underneath everything
I think I've got some secret strain of lower
middle-class respectability."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad it hasn't hampered your taste in
nightdresses," said Tony.  "That would have been a
tragedy."  He helped himself to another cigarette.
"Well, you're going to come in with us and battle
for your rights, then?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"Every time," observed Molly with decision.
</p>

<p>
"I know where I am now, and that will make all the
difference.  Up till to-day I have sort of been
fighting in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Peter again?" inquired Tony.
</p>

<p>
Molly nodded.  "He was here yesterday.  He
wouldn't tell me anything, but I could see he was
nearly worried out of his life.  I don't believe it's
entirely about this girl&mdash;I am sure from the way he
spoke that things are coming to a head out in
Livadia."
</p>

<p>
"I expect they are," said Tony.  "You can't work
up a revolution and then postpone it like a mothers'
meeting.  Isabel's disappearance must have made
Da Freitas as mad as a wet hen.  It's come just at
the wrong moment."
</p>

<p>
"Is this girl really so like me?" asked Molly.
</p>

<p>
"Wonderfully," said Tony; "considering how
rare beauty is.  She has got brown eyes instead of
blue, but any one who was short-sighted or a little
intoxicated might easily mistake her for you.
Probably that's why Peter wanted to kiss her that night
after dinner."
</p>

<p>
Molly looked a little sceptical.  "Peter will kiss
anybody," she said, "especially when he's had a
drink or two."  She paused.  "Still, I don't think
I like her being quite so like me," she added thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"It can't be helped," said Tony.  "I expect Heaven
had some of the material left over, and didn't want
to waste it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm not worrying really," replied Molly.
</p>

<p>
"I've become a sort of habit to Peter.  He would be
absolutely lost without me now.  He said as much
himself yesterday, and he's not given to making pretty
speeches.  You see I'm the only girl he has ever known
who was really fond of him for his own sake.  All the
rest have been absolute rotters."
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't deserve his luck," said Tony severely.
"It's incredible that any one could be so stupid as to
prefer sitting on a throne in Livadia to stopping in
London and making love to you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's not his fault," protested Molly.  "It's
all that old pig Da Freitas.  Peter knows perfectly
well he is not fit to be a king.  I have told him so
again and again, and in his heart he absolutely agrees
with me.  He always makes a mess of things if I'm
not there to look after him."
</p>

<p>
Tony got up from the bed.  "It's really a work of
pure benevolence that we're engaged on," he
observed.  "We might almost christen ourselves the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Peter, and
appeal for a public subscription."  He picked up his
hat off the chair.  "Well anyhow, Molly," he added,
"from to-day we shall consider you one of us, and
keep you posted up in everything that goes on."
</p>

<p>
"Right-oh," replied Molly cheerfully, "and the
same here.  I am quite sure that if Peter is going to
do anything very desperate he'll let me know about
it in spite of Da Freitas.  Anyhow, it won't be my
fault if he doesn't."
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose it will," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
He bent down and implanted a kiss just under her
chin, which Molly considerately elevated for the
purpose, and then, after having bestowed half a
sovereign upon Claudine who glided out into the hall
to open the front door for him, he clambered back
into his car and set off on the return journey.
</p>

<p>
Having arrived home he drove up to the garage,
and leaving the car in the care of Jennings, walked
down the path on to the lawn where he had left Guy
and Isabel.  The chairs they had been sitting on were
still there, but there was no sign of their late
occupants.  Thinking that perhaps another botany lesson
was in progress, Tony strolled on round the garden,
but except for a white whiskered gentleman who was
doing something mysterious with a spade, the place
seemed to be deserted.  He returned to the house,
and entering the morning-room by the open French
window rang the bell for Spalding.
</p>

<p>
"They have gone across to number sixteen, Sir
Antony," replied the latter in answer to his inquiry.
"Miss Francis wished to return before lunch, and
Mr. Guy told me to inform you that he and Bugg had
walked across with her.  They will be back by one
o'clock."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you heard about our little entertainment
there yesterday?" said Tony.
</p>

<p>
Spalding inclined his head.  "Mrs. Spalding informed
me of the facts, sir.  They appear to have
made a considerable impression upon her."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Spalding was magnificent," said Tony.
"It's quite impossible to frighten her."
</p>

<p>
"Quite, sir," agreed Spalding.  "I have observed
that myself, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you don't object, Spalding," said Tony.
"I don't think we did any harm to your property."
</p>

<p>
"That's perfectly all right, sir," replied the butler.
"I trust that you will consider yourself quite at home
there.  The house is fully insured."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Spalding," said Tony.  "You are
always very obliging."
</p>

<p>
Spalding acknowledged the compliment with
another grave bow, and picking up the current copy
of the <i>Auto Car</i>, which contained a description of the
last Brooklands meeting, Tony sauntered out again
on to the lawn.
</p>

<p>
Here he established himself comfortably in a
basket-chair, and after lighting a pipe, opened the
paper at the article in question.  It was enriched
with several complimentary references to himself and
his driving, and Tony, who liked to hear agreeable
sentiments expressed about any one that he was fond
of, read it through with appreciative interest.  He
had just finished, and was lying back in the sunshine
in a pleasant state of contentment with the Universe,
when the French window opened and Spalding came
down on to the lawn, carrying a small silver salver,
containing a couple of visiting cards.  He advanced
to where Tony was sitting.
</p>

<p>
"Two gentlemen have called, sir, and would like
to see you."
</p>

<p>
Tony took out his pipe and shook off the ash on
to the grass.
</p>

<p>
"What are their names, Spalding?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
The butler glanced at the cards as if to refresh his
memory.
</p>

<p>
"They are two foreign gentlemen, Sir Antony.
The Marquis da Freitas, and the Count de Sé."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
A MOVE BY THE ENEMY
</h3>

<p>
There was a moment's pause, and then in a
leisurely fashion Tony knocked the remaining tobacco
out of his pipe, and put it away in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"How jolly!" he observed.  "What have you
done with them?"
</p>

<p>
"I have shown them into the library, Sir Antony."
</p>

<p>
Tony got up from his chair and pulled down his
coat.
</p>

<p>
"Do I look respectable, Spalding?" he asked.  "I
shouldn't like to receive such distinguished visitors
with any suggestion of slovenliness."
</p>

<p>
Spalding inspected him carefully, and then stepping
forward removed a small piece of white thread from
the knee of his trousers.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing the matter now, Sir Antony,"
he replied.
</p>

<p>
Tony walked leisurely up the steps into the house,
and crossing the morning-room and the hall, opened
the door of the library.
</p>

<p>
Da Freitas and the Count, both irreproachably
dressed in frock coats, were standing on the hearth-rug.
</p>

<p>
"Hulloa, Marquis!" observed Tony.  "This is
awfully nice of you to come and look me up.  A sort
of burying of the pugilistic hatchet, eh?"
</p>

<p>
With an affable bow the Marquis accepted his
proffered hand.
</p>

<p>
"It is my hope that we shall always be good
friends," he replied in that smooth purring voice of
his.  Then indicating his companion, he added: "May
I have the honour of presenting you to the Count
de Sé?"
</p>

<p>
Tony shook hands in turn with the Count, who
in contrast with the urbane Da Freitas appeared
nervous and ill at ease.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do?" said Tony.  "I suppose it's
my imagination, but d'you know I can't help feeling
I have seen you before somewhere."
</p>

<p>
For a moment the Count seemed at a loss how to
reply, and before he could recover himself the
Marquis da Freitas had taken up the gauntlet.
</p>

<p>
"You are right, Sir Antony.  You made the
Count's acquaintance in Richmond Park the day
before yesterday.  It is that meeting to a certain
extent which is responsible for our visit."
</p>

<p>
With an air of pleased remembrance, Tony turned
back to Isabel's guardian.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," he exclaimed.  "How stupid
of me!  I say, I hope you didn't hurt yourself when
you fell off the car?"
</p>

<p>
The Count drew himself up.  "It is through a
miracle that I was not killed," he replied with some
stiffness.
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded sympathetically.  "I know," he
said.  "That's the danger of a clay soil.  It gets so
hard in hot weather."
</p>

<p>
A sudden tinge of colour appeared in the Count's
parchment-like face, and once again the soothing
tones of Da Freitas broke in upon the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"I expect," he said suavely, "that we have all
been more or less under a misunderstanding.  I
am quite sure that when matters are explained this
little Comedy of Errors will settle itself."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't wonder," said Tony.  "But won't
you both sit down and have a cigar?  There's no
reason we shouldn't be comfortable while we are
talking."
</p>

<p>
He took a box off the mantelpiece and held it out
in turn to his two guests.  Da Freitas helped
himself, and after a second's hesitation the Count
followed suit, as though the tempting appearance of the
cabanas that it contained had proved too strong for
his contemplated refusal.
</p>

<p>
It was Da Freitas who reopened the conversation.
Having seated himself on the broad leather-covered
couch against the wall, he took an appreciative pull at
his cigar, and then removed it carefully from between
his thick lips.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," he said, "that you are aware who the
young lady is that you have apparently been
good-natured enough to assist?"
</p>

<p>
It was the identical question that Congosta had
opened with, and Tony answered it in much the same
fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," he said.  "When I make new
friends I am always most careful about their
antecedents."
</p>

<p>
The Marquis looked up at him sharply, but Tony's
face remained absolutely expressionless.
</p>

<p>
"As you may imagine," continued the former, "it
was a cause of infinite relief to the Count and myself
to learn that her foolish escapade had had no more
serious consequences."  He paused.  "We should
be interested to learn how and under what
circumstances you became acquainted."
</p>

<p>
"We were introduced by a mutual acquaintance
in Long Acre," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
The Marquis raised his eyebrows.  "Ah, indeed!"
he replied courteously.  "I had no idea that Isabella
had any acquaintances in London.  That was one
thing that made us so extremely anxious about her."
</p>

<p>
He paused again as though giving Tony an opportunity
to be a little more communicative&mdash;a thoughtful
attention which the latter appeared to overlook.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," he continued with a good-natured
laugh, "that the dear foolish child has been telling
you of the terrible tragedies of a high destiny.  She
is incredibly romantic as you have doubtless seen.
It's a charming weakness in a young girl, but"&mdash;he
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"well, sometimes we poor
elders are forced to appear unsympathetic in order
to be kind."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Tony, "so I gather."
</p>

<p>
Again the Marquis glanced at him quickly, and
then as if partly reassured by the perfect tranquillity
of his countenance, proceeded in the same strain of
benevolent urbanity.
</p>

<p>
"To youth the claims of duty must always seem
hard and unreasonable.  One would not wish it
otherwise.  If we were not a little unwise and
impatient in the spring-time of life, what interest would
be left to us for the autumn and the winter?"  He
took another pull at his cigar, and blew out a
philosophic cloud of smoke.  "I presume," he added
smilingly, "that you are fully acquainted with the
main cause of our little runaway's desperate decision?"
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said Tony, "that she was unable
to appreciate the more subtle points of her selected
husband?"
</p>

<p>
Da Freitas waved his hand indulgently.  "Ah, well,
my dear Sir Antony, between ourselves I do not mind
admitting that His Majesty is not perhaps the figure
of Romance that a young girl pictures in her dreams.
But what would you?  He loves her devotedly, and
he will make her a good&mdash;an excellent husband.  It
will be an ideal marriage in every way."
</p>

<p>
"You really think so?" said Tony artlessly.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure of it.  Why should I have encouraged
it otherwise?  We have nothing to gain politically
by such a match.  His Majesty might have made an
alliance with one of the most powerful reigning houses
in Europe, but he loves his cousin, and I am
old-fashioned enough to believe that when there is no
great objection it is best to follow the counsels of the
heart."
</p>

<p>
"But there is a grave objection," said Tony, "&mdash;on
the lady's part."
</p>

<p>
Again Da Freitas shrugged his shoulders.  "My
dear Sir Antony&mdash;a young girl's whims and fancies!
What are they anyway?  Three parts shyness and
modesty.  Within a week of her marriage she will
be perfectly happy and contented."
</p>

<p>
Tony leaned back and crossed his legs.  "Well,
I'll tell her what you say," he observed, "but I am
afraid I can't hold out much hope."
</p>

<p>
There was a short and rather pregnant silence.
</p>

<p>
"The position does not appear to be quite clear
to you, Sir Antony," remarked Da Freitas with a
somewhat excessive politeness.  "While we appreciate
your friendly offer of assistance, there can be
no question of our sending messages through any
third party.  The Count de Sé is Her Highness's
legal guardian, and the sooner she is returned to his
care and protection, the better it will be for
everybody concerned."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay," replied Tony lazily; "but you see
there's a difficulty in the way.  She dislikes him
even more than she does you and Pedro."
</p>

<p>
Da Freitas controlled himself admirably.
</p>

<p>
"It is scarcely a question of Her Highness's personal
feelings," he observed.  "I fancy that we are
the best judges of her future welfare, and in any case
the present state of affairs cannot possibly be allowed
to continue."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why," persisted Tony cheerfully.
"I have adopted Isabel as a cousin, and the
arrangement suits us both excellently.  Of course I am sorry
in a way that Pedro should be disappointed, but
after all it only serves him right.  I don't approve of
a young man marrying a nice girl, unless he has led
a healthy and reputable life."
</p>

<p>
This was too much for the Count de Sé, who
started up in his chair with an indignant gasp.
</p>

<p>
"Sir!" he exclaimed.  "You are insolent."
</p>

<p>
Tony looked across at him with perfect good
temper.
</p>

<p>
"We are all insolent in England," he said.
"It's the result of there being no duelling."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Antony is indulging his sense of humour,"
broke in Da Freitas with a dangerous suavity.  "We
can hardly insult his intelligence by suggesting that
he is taking up this position seriously.  Otherwise
it might be necessary to remind him that in this great
and admirable country of his there is such a thing as
the Law."
</p>

<p>
"I have been told," said Tony, "that it is our
supreme national achievement."
</p>

<p>
"It is at least effective," replied Da Freitas with
some significance.  "I understand that it takes a
very definite view as to the detention of a minor from
her legal guardian."
</p>

<p>
"There is only one trouble about the law in England,"
said Tony.  "It's inclined to be slow in its
operation."
</p>

<p>
Da Freitas' white teeth exhibited themselves in a
smile.
</p>

<p>
"That," he observed, "is a universal weakness in
legal systems, but fortunately there are ways and
methods of overcoming it.  In the present case, for
instance, I fancy that a few words from me to your
extremely courteous and obliging Foreign Office
might have a very far-reaching effect."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure they would," said Tony cordially.
"In fact I shouldn't be the least surprised if they
reached as far as Livadia.  It's extraordinary how
news travels&mdash;especially interesting and romantic
news of this sort."
</p>

<p>
Once again there was a pause in the conversation.
Then Da Freitas laughed&mdash;easily and pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"If that remark is intended for a threat, I am
afraid that your information is a little out of date.
His Majesty's intentions are already known to the
government at Portriga."
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "I wasn't thinking so
much about the government," he said.  "It was the
friends and supporters of the late Don Francisco
that I had in my mind.  I've got an idea that some
of them might like to come over to Richmond and
congratulate the Count on having arranged such a
satisfactory marriage."
</p>

<p>
The effect that this innocent remark produced
upon Isabel's uncle was prompt and remarkable.  His
naturally unpleasant complexion went a sort of dirty
green, and flinging his half-smoked cigar on the
carpet he rose unsteadily to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Are we to sit here and be threatened and insulted
any longer?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Apparently not," said Tony, "but all the same
there's no need to burn a hole in my nice carpet."
</p>

<p>
With a masterful gesture Da Freitas checked his
companion's outburst.  Then he too rose from the
sofa, and stood facing Tony with the same easy and
smiling urbanity that he had displayed all through
the interview.
</p>

<p>
"We are flattered at your interest in the affairs of
our afflicted country, Sir Antony; but if you will
forgive my offering you a little advice, it is a
dangerous habit to make a plaything out of what other
people take seriously."
</p>

<p>
Tony stepped to the fireplace and pressed the
electric bell.
</p>

<p>
"All real pleasure seems to have a certain amount
of risk about it," he admitted sadly.  "The only
thing to do is to hope for the best and take every
proper precaution."
</p>

<p>
The Marquis picked up his hat from the table on
which he had placed it.
</p>

<p>
"I have heard more foolish remarks," he observed,
"from considerably wiser people."
</p>

<p>
There was a sound outside, and then the door
opened and Spalding appeared on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
Tony turned to his guests.  "Have you got a
car?" he inquired, "or can my man drive you anywhere?"
</p>

<p>
Da Freitas bowed.  "You are very kind," he
said, "but there is no need to trouble you.  We are
in the fortunate position of being able to look after
ourselves&mdash;in every way."
</p>

<p>
He walked to the door, followed by the Count de
Sé, who haughtily ignored Tony's polite farewell.
Leaning against the mantelpiece the latter waited
placidly until he heard the grind and scrunch of the
departing car, and then strolling out into the hall
discovered Spalding in the act of closing the front
door.
</p>

<p>
"Have Miss Francis and Mr. Guy come back
yet?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Sir Antony," replied Spalding.  "They
returned a few minutes ago and are waiting in
the garden.  I took the liberty of informing
them who your visitors were.  You had given no
instructions, but I thought you might wish them
to know."
</p>

<p>
"It's a waste of time giving you instructions,
Spalding," said Tony.  "Your instincts are so
invariably accurate."
</p>

<p>
Spalding, as usual, acknowledged the compliment
with a slight bow.
</p>

<p>
"Would you wish lunch to be served, sir?" he
inquired.  "Or shall I put it off for a quarter of an
hour?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, you can bring it up," said Tony.  "I
want support.  There is something very exhausting
about the foreign aristocracy."
</p>

<p>
He strolled out into the garden, where Isabel and
Guy, who were back in their old seats, jumped up
eagerly to meet him.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" they inquired simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
"Fairly so," said Tony, "considering what I have
been through.  I had no idea that this conspiracy
business was such an intellectual strain."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what did Da Freitas say?" asked Isabel
clasping her hands.  "I could almost see him standing
there smiling and threatening you in that horrible
smooth way of his."
</p>

<p>
"He was in quite good form," said Tony cheerfully,
"and so was Uncle Phil."  He put his arm
through hers.  "But come along in and I'll tell you
all about it while we are having some food.  We
mustn't allow our pleasures to interfere with the
more serious duties of life."
</p>

<p>
They made their way to the dining-room, where
Spalding was just bringing in lunch, and over an
excellent saddle of mutton Tony gave them a leisurely
but animated description of his recent interview.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you think," he finished,
"but my own idea is that Da Freitas was skidding
a little from the truth when he said that the
Republican government knew all about Peter's
matrimonial plans.  I don't see how they can,
unless Congosta's people have told them, and that
isn't likely."
</p>

<p>
"They may have spies of their own," suggested
Guy.  "They must know that the King is plotting
to come back, and you can be pretty sure that they
are keeping an eye on him some way or other."  He
paused.  "I wonder what Da Freitas will do
next!" he added.
</p>

<p>
"We needn't worry ourselves," said Tony.  "We
shall find out before very long.  I never saw a
middle-aged nobleman more obviously bent upon immediate
mischief."
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded her agreement.  "He always has
some plan ready if another one fails.  In Livadia
when he was Prime Minister they used to call him
the Black Spider."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he knows where Isabel is?" asked Guy.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't wonder," said Tony placidly.  "He
gave me the impression of having several aces up his
sleeve."
</p>

<p>
Guy frowned thoughtfully.  "I don't think it's
very safe leaving her at Spalding's with only Bugg
to look after her.  These people have big interests
at stake and they won't mind what methods they
employ."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Tony, "to do Da Freitas justice I
shouldn't think there was any maudlin fastidiousness
about him."  He paused to mix himself a
whisky and soda.  "I am inclined to think you're
right, Guy.  The best thing with these strong,
unscrupulous men is to put temptation out of their
reach."
</p>

<p>
"How do you propose to do it?" asked Guy.
</p>

<p>
"I shall go along this afternoon to Aunt Fanny
and see if I can't persuade her to ask Isabel to come
and stay.  She ought to be quite safe there.  No one
would ever think of looking for a Queen in Chester
Square.  It's so respectable."
</p>

<p>
"I seem to be getting more of a bother than ever,"
observed Isabel in rather a distressed voice.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," said Guy firmly.  "Every right-minded
person finds it a pleasure and a privilege to
prevent injustice being done."
</p>

<p>
"Especially to any one beautiful," added Tony.
"It's wonderful how beauty quickens one's ethical
sense."  He turned to Isabel.  "How would you
like to go to a music hall to-night?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Very much," said Isabel promptly.
</p>

<p>
A faint cloud of disapproval showed itself on
Guy's forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think a theatre would be more&mdash;more
appropriate?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Tony, "I don't.  Isabel knows nothing
of the deeper and better side of our English
national life, and it's quite time she learned.  I shall
take her to the Empire."  He paused.  "I don't
like leaving her alone all this afternoon though," he
added thoughtfully.  "I suppose you couldn't possibly
snatch an hour or two, Guy&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I shall be all right," interrupted Isabel
hastily.  "You mustn't think of putting yourself
out for me, Cousin Guy."
</p>

<p>
Guy laid down his knife and fork.  "My dear
Isabel," he said in that precise and dignified manner
of his; "when you know Tony as well as I do, you
won't pay the faintest attention to his remarks.  I
am not the least busy this afternoon and I shall be
only too pleased if you will accept my company."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be delighted," said Isabel, "but I am not
really frightened of Da Freitas now.  Look what I
got yesterday."
</p>

<p>
She slipped her hand into an inside pocket of the
tailormade coat that she was wearing, and pulled out
a tiny little ivory-handled pistol, which she held out
for Tony's inspection.
</p>

<p>
"It's one of Harrod's," she added, "I saw it in his
list.  Isn't it nice?"
</p>

<p>
"Charming," said Tony.  "I had no idea that
Harrod was so blood-thirsty."
</p>

<p>
"Is it loaded?" inquired Guy with a faint trace of
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said Isabel promptly.  "Harrod says
it will kill a man at ten yards."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to hit Da Freitas all right at ten
yards," observed Tony critically.  "He's very
podgy."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't encourage her in such ideas,"
broke in Guy.  "We are not in Livadia or South
America."  He turned to Isabel.  "People don't
shoot at each other in England," he explained.
"It's against the law and they would be very severely
punished.  You had better give me that to look after
for you."
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head.  "I shall shoot at him
if he tries to take me back," she said with
determination.  "I would rather go to prison than marry
Pedro."
</p>

<p>
"A very healthy and reasonable sentiment,"
remarked Tony.  "Guy has the most morbid ideas
about the sanctity of human life.  He ought to
belong to the National Liberal Club."
</p>

<p>
Isabel put back the pistol into her pocket, and
after one more unavailing effort Guy abandoned his
protest as useless.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it's on a par with the rest of the
situation," he observed gloomily.  "We shall probably
all end in prison or something worse before we've
finished."
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed and pushed across the whisky.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Guy," he replied in an encouraging
voice.  "We shall be able to look back on beautiful
and well-spent lives, and that's the only thing that
really matters."
</p>

<p>
It was close on four o'clock when Tony arrived at
Chester Square, and was shown up to the drawing-room
by Lady Jocelyn's trim and efficient-looking
parlour-maid.  Lady Jocelyn herself was sitting on
the sofa reading one of Anatole France's earlier
novels, and she shut the book up with a pleased
smile as her visitor appeared on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Tony," she said.  "How nice of you to
come so soon.  I have been positively ill with curiosity.
It's the only disease I can't bear with dignity."
</p>

<p>
Tony kissed her affectionately and sat down on the
sofa beside her.
</p>

<p>
"I have brought you the cure, Aunt Fanny," he
replied, "but I'm afraid it's rather an exhausting
one.  Do you feel strong enough to listen to a long
and distressing story, involving some of the noblest
names in Europe?"
</p>

<p>
"The longer and distressinger it is," said Lady
Jocelyn, "the more I shall enjoy it."  She stretched
out her hand to a small table beside her, and pressed
an electric bell.  "But perhaps we had better have
tea up first," she added.  "A cup of tea improves the
best scandal in the world.  It makes it seem more
abandoned."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that accounts for the great wealth of
Lipton and Lyons," said Tony.  "I had always put
it down to their Scottish blood."
</p>

<p>
The neat parlour-maid returned, and having been
requested to bring tea, duly performed that operation
with the deftness and celerity that characterized all
Lady Jocelyn's servants.  Then, having received
instructions that no other visitors were to be
admitted, she retired gracefully from the scene, closing
the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
"Now you can begin, Tony," said Lady Jocelyn,
handing him one of her fragile Sèvres cups.  "Speak
slowly and don't omit any of the more painful details.
I can bear anything provided it's sufficiently
scandalous."
</p>

<p>
Thus encouraged Tony entered upon his task, and
in practically the same words as he had already told
it to Molly he repeated the moving story of his
discovery of Isabel, and the bracing results which had
sprung from their acquaintance.  Lady Jocelyn
listened to him with a silent but deep enjoyment
which showed itself plainly in her twinkling black
eyes.  Like Molly she made no interruptions until
he had finished, contenting herself with an occasional
nod or an appreciative smile as the more interesting
developments gradually unrolled themselves.  When
the whole story was finally concluded, she lay back
against the cushions and surveyed him with a sort
of affectionate approval.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Tony," she said.  "I have done you a
great injustice.  Ever since you were a small boy,
I have admired your efforts at brightening the family
life, but I never suspected you were capable of
anything like this."
</p>

<p>
"I think I have always been a little misunderstood,"
answered Tony modestly.  "Some people
develop late, you know."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn laughed softly.  "I can now depart
in peace," she said.  "If any one had told me that
I should live to see Laura and Henry mixed up even
remotely in a bloodthirsty European scandal&mdash;"  She
broke off, as if mere words were inadequate to
express the depth of her emotions.
</p>

<p>
"It is rather joyous, isn't it?" said Tony.  "Still
it's their own fault, you know.  They have been
worrying me to take up some serious profession ever
since the war."
</p>

<p>
"Well, they can't complain then," agreed Lady
Jocelyn.  "Kidnapping Queens is one of the most
serious professions that any young man could
possibly adopt."  She arranged herself a little more
comfortably on the sofa, and looked across at Tony
with a smile.  "And what about my part in the
play?" she asked.  "Am I to be the Fairy Godmother?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment Tony paused.  "I don't know," he
said.  "Upon my soul I don't like to drag you into
it, Aunt Fanny."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," retorted Lady Jocelyn briskly.
"People of my age require a little mental stimulant
to keep their interest in life alive."  She paused.
"Besides, you must think of the girl.  Even a
Princess's reputation has to be considered."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "That's our weak point," he
observed.  "We've got a good hand, but we're a bit
thin on chaperons."
</p>

<p>
"It's quite simple," said Lady Jocelyn.  "You
must bring her to stay with me.  I am sure we should
get along together excellently.  I like girls with red
hair."
</p>

<p>
"I did think of it," admitted Tony; "but you
know, Aunt Fanny, it's really rather risky.  Those
sleek purring people like Da Freitas are dangerous
beggars when they mean mischief."
</p>

<p>
"I am not frightened," answered Lady Jocelyn
calmly.  "There is a very reliable policeman at the
corner, and the house is heavily insured."  She
laid down the piece of silk knitting which she had
picked up after tea.  "Tony," she said suddenly,
"I have got an idea.  If you are really determined to
play the knight errant for this young woman, why
don't you put that very comfortable steam yacht of
yours into commission and take her away out of
danger?  If you will go to some nice place I don't
mind coming with you and looking after the
proprieties.  I am very fond of a sea voyage even now."
</p>

<p>
Tony sat up and gazed at her with admiration.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Aunt Fanny!" he exclaimed.  "That's
not an idea.  That's a stroke of pure genius."  He
paused as if to allow the full brilliance of the
suggestion to sink into him.  "I could bring Guy too," he
added, "and then we should have a four for bridge."
</p>

<p>
"If Guy would come," said Lady Jocelyn.  "He
probably considers the ocean not quite respectable."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he'd come all right," said Tony.  "He's
getting much broader-minded, especially where
Isabel's concerned."  He got up from the sofa.
"I will send a wire to Simmons on my way back.
The <i>Betty</i> is in Southampton and it won't take more
than a day or two to get her ready."
</p>

<p>
"You are going to bring Isabel to stay with me
just the same, I suppose?" asked Lady Jocelyn.
"Apart altogether from Mrs. Grundy, I should think
it would be much safer for her to leave Hampstead.
I expect Da Freitas knows where she is, and in that
case she must be in a certain amount of danger."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "I will bring her along myself
to-morrow morning," he said.  "The house is probably
watched, but I shall take her a nice little run
in the Peugot first.  I don't think any one will find
out where we finish up."  He paused.  "You really
are a darling, Aunt Fanny," he added.  "I have no
idea how to thank you."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn smiled at him placidly.  "I will tell
you, Tony," she said, "after I have seen Isabel."
</p>

<p>
There is a small confectioner's shop, not a hundred
yards from Victoria Station, which for some dark
purpose of his own the Post Master General has
enriched with a Telegraph Office.  Here Tony
halted the car on his return journey, and sauntering
up to the desk inside, selected a form, which after
some consideration he filled up with the following
message:&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
  To CAPTAIN SIMMONS,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steam yacht Betty,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southampton.<br />
</p>

<p>
Please make all preparations immediate sailing.
Party of six or seven including servants.  Duration of
voyage uncertain.  Wire earliest date likely to be ready.
Hope you're well.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
CONWAY.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He handed it to the girl behind the counter, an
anæmic young lady of about seventeen, who having
read it carefully with the aid of a pencil, looked up at
him with a rather wistful envy.
</p>

<p>
"One shilling and eightpence," she observed.
Then in a low voice she added: "Wish I was comin'
too.  Some people have all the luck."
</p>

<p>
Tony put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a
five-pound note.  He glanced round, and seeing that
no one was observing them, pushed it across the
counter.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Gwendoline," he said encouragingly.
"Pay for the telegram out of that, and try to keep
the other nine commandments."
</p>

<p>
Then, before the astounded young lady had recovered
her power of speech, he lifted his hat, and
strolled off out of the shop in the same leisurely
fashion as he had entered it.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
A DISTURBANCE IN HAMPSTEAD
</h3>

<p>
Isabel gazed round the cheerful, brightly lighted
little restaurant with a glance of complete contentment.
</p>

<p>
"I am quite sure father was wrong about our
being the rightful heirs to the throne," she said.
"Anyhow, I don't feel the least like a queen."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't be so exacting," replied Tony.
"You look like one; and that's all that any
reasonable girl has any right to expect."
</p>

<p>
"Still," persisted Isabel, "I expect that proper
kings and queens have a special sort of Royal feeling
inside.  I haven't got it in the least.  I have been a
thousand times happier since I ran away than I ever
should be if I was stuck up on a throne.  It's the
silly pretence of it all that I should hate so.  Even the
sort of semi-state that we used to keep up when
Father was alive nearly drove me mad.  It was like
being surrounded by a lot of stupid shadows.  Do
you know that except for Miss Watson, you and
Cousin Guy are the first <i>real</i> people I have ever met."
</p>

<p>
"There are not many about," said Tony.  "At
least that's how it seems to me.  I always feel as if I
was in the stalls of a theatre looking on at a play.
The only real people are one's friends who are sitting
alongside, criticizing and abusing it."
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded.  "It's the first time I have been in
the audience," she said.  "Up till now I haven't
even done any acting.  I have just been waiting
behind the scenes as a sort of understudy."
</p>

<p>
They had just finished dinner and were dawdling
pleasantly over coffee and cigarettes in the soothing
atmosphere of the Café Bruges.  They had chosen
that discreet but excellent little restaurant as the one
in which they were least likely to run across inconvenient
acquaintances, since its clientele consists almost
entirely of Board of Trade officials, who take
little interest in anything outside of their own
absorbing profession.  Compared with these deserving but
sombre people Isabel looked very young and charming.
The strained, hunted look had quite gone out
of her face, and in the softly shaded light her amber
eyes shone with a contented happiness that Tony
found extremely attractive.
</p>

<p>
"I think you will find Aunt Fanny real enough,"
he said, tipping off the end of his cigarette into the
saucer.  "At least she always seems amazingly so to me."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure we shall get along together splendidly,"
said Isabel.  "She sounds a dear from what you have
told me about her."
</p>

<p>
"She is," replied Tony with as near an approach to
enthusiasm as he ever attained.  "She is the most
complete and delightful aunt in the world.  Fancy
an ordinary aunt of seventy-two offering to come
with us on the <i>Betty</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"I am looking forward to it so much," exclaimed
Isabel happily.  "I love the sea.  I should like to go
right round the world and then back again."
</p>

<p>
Tony contemplated her with lazy enjoyment.  "Well,
there's nothing to stop us," he said, "unless
Aunt Fanny or Guy object.  I am afraid it's not
quite Guy's idea of a really useful and intelligent
employment."
</p>

<p>
"He <i>is</i> serious," admitted Isabel, "but he is very
kind.  I daresay he wouldn't mind if I asked him
nicely."
</p>

<p>
"It's quite possible," said Tony gravely.  He
glanced at his watch.  "We ought to be getting along
to the Empire," he added, "or we shall miss the
performing sea lions.  I wouldn't have that happen
for anything in the world."
</p>

<p>
He paid the bill, and leaving the restaurant they
strolled off through the brightly lighted streets in the
direction of Leicester Square.  It was a delightfully
fine evening, and Isabel, who had insisted on walking,
drank in the varied scene with an interest and
enjoyment that would have satisfied Charles Lamb.
There was a freshness and excitement about her
pleasure in it all that spoke eloquently of the dull
life she must have been forced to lead by her guardian,
and Tony felt more gratified than ever at his
remembrance of the heavy thud with which that
gentleman had rebounded from the sun-baked soil
of Richmond Park.
</p>

<p>
It cannot justly be said that the Empire
programme contained any very refreshing novelties,
but Isabel's enthusiasm was contagious.  Tony
found himself applauding the sea lions and the latest
half naked dancer with generous if indiscriminating
heartiness, while the jests of a certain comedian took
on a delicate freshness that they had not known since
the earliest years of the century.
</p>

<p>
It was not until the orchestra had completed
their somewhat hasty rendering of <i>God Save the King</i>,
that Isabel, with a little sigh of satisfaction, expressed
herself ready to depart.  They strolled down together
to the R.A.C. Garage where Tony had left
the car, and in a few minutes they were picking their
way through the still crowded streets of the West
End in the direction of Hampstead.
</p>

<p>
From Tottenham Court Road they had a beautiful
clear run home, the Hispano sweeping up Haverstock
Hill with that effortless rhythm that only a perfectly
tuned-up car can achieve.  They rounded the quiet
deserted corner of Latimer Lane, and gliding gently
along in the shadow of the trees, pulled up noiselessly
outside Mrs. Spalding's house.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo," said Tony.  "Somebody else has been
dissipating too."
</p>

<p>
He pointed up the road to where about thirty
yards ahead, the tail-light of another car could be
seen outside one of the houses.
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed with a kind of soft happiness.  "I
hope they have had as nice an evening as we have,"
she observed generously.
</p>

<p>
Pulling her skirt round her, she stepped lightly out
of the car, and having switched off the engine, Tony
followed suit.
</p>

<p>
"I will just come in and see that everything's
right," he said.  "I told Bugg that we should be
back about eleven-thirty."
</p>

<p>
He moved towards the gate which was in deep
shadow and laid his hand upon the latch.  As he
did so there was the faintest possible rustle in
the darkness beside him.  With amazing swiftness
he wheeled round in the direction of the sound,
but even so he was just too late.  A savage blow
in the mouth sent him staggering back against
the gate-post and then before he could recover
a figure leapt out on him with the swiftness
of a panther, and clutched him viciously around
the body.  At the same instant a second man
sprang out from the gloom, and snatched up Isabel
in his arms.
</p>

<p>
Half dazed as he was by the blow, Tony struggled
fiercely with his unknown assailant.  Swaying and
straining they crashed backwards together into the
garden gate, and the suffocating grip round his waist
momentarily slackened.
</p>

<p>
"Bugg!" he roared at the top of his voice.
"Bugg!!"  In the darkness a hand seized him by the
throat, but with a tremendous effort he managed to
shake it off, and jerking his head forward brought
the top of his forehead in violent contact with the
bridge of his assailant's nose.  A yelp of agony
went up into the night, and at the same instant a
swift patter of footsteps could be heard hurrying
down the garden path.
</p>

<p>
Either this sound or else the pain of the blow
seemed to have a disturbing effect upon the stranger,
for once again his grip loosened and with a final
effort Tony tore himself free.  He was panting for
breath, and the blood was trickling from his cut lips,
but his only thought was for Isabel's safety.  Thirty
yards away in the gleam of his own headlights he
could see a furious scuffle taking place outside the
other car.  With a shout of encouragement he hurled
himself to the rescue, and even as he did so the quick
sharp sound of a pistol rang out like the crack of a
whip.  The struggling mass broke up into two
figures&mdash;one of which reeled against the car with
his hands to its head, while the other&mdash;Isabel
herself&mdash;staggered back feebly in the opposite
direction.  Tony flung his last available ounce
of energy into a supreme effort, but the distance
was too great to cover in the time.  Just as he
reached the spot there came the grinding clang
of a clutch being hastily thrust in, and the car
jerked off up the road with the door swinging loose
upon its hinges.
</p>

<p>
For a moment both he and Isabel were too exhausted
to speak.  Panting and trembling she clung
to his shoulder, the little smoking pistol still clutched
tightly in her hand.
</p>

<p>
Tony was the first to recover his breath.
</p>

<p>
"Well done, Isabel," he gasped.
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him, her breast rising and falling
quickly, and her brown eyes full of a sort of
passionate concern.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Tony," she said, "you're hurt.  Your face is
all covered with blood."
</p>

<p>
Tony pulled out his handkerchief and dabbed it
against his lips.  "It's nothing," he said cheerfully,
"nothing at all.  I bleed very easily if any one hits
me in the mouth.  All really well bred people do."  He
bent down and took the little pistol out of her
hand.  "Who was the gentleman you shot?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head.  "I don't know.  I have
never seen him before.  He was a rough, common
man with a red face.'
</p>

<p>
"He ought to die all right anyhow," said Tony
hopefully.  "It was nothing like the ten yards, and
Harrod is very reliable as a rule."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid he won't," said Isabel in a rather
depressed voice.  "I aimed at his head, but he
ducked and I think I only shot his ear off."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we won't bother to look for it," said Tony.
"I don't suppose it was a particularly nice one."  He
turned and glanced down the road.  "Hullo,"
he added, "here comes Bugg!  I wonder what he's
done with the other chap."
</p>

<p>
With an anxious expression upon his face, the
faithful "Tiger" was hurrying along the pavement
towards them, moving with that swift cat-like tread
that stamps the well-trained athlete.  He pulled up
with a sigh of relief on seeing that they were both
apparently safe.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry I was so long comin', Sir Ant'ny," he
observed.  "I didn't 'ear nothin'&mdash;not till you shouts
'Bugg.'"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't notice any appreciable delay," replied
Tony kindly.  "Who was our little friend at the
gate?"
</p>

<p>
Bugg's face hardened into the somewhat grim
expression it generally wore in the ring.  "It was that
swine Lopez&mdash;beggin' your pardon, miss.  But it was
'im all right, sir: there ain't no error abaht that."
</p>

<p>
Tony's damaged lips framed themselves into a low
whistle.  "Lopez, was it!" he said softly.  "I ought
to have guessed.  There was a touch of the expert
about that punch."
</p>

<p>
"'E ain't 'urt yer, 'as 'e, sir?" demanded Bugg
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," said Tony, "but he had a very praise-worthy try."
</p>

<p>
Bugg chuckled.  "You done it on <i>'im</i> proper, sir.
I seed 'is face w'en 'e come aht in the lamp-light, and
'e didn't look as if 'e wanted no more.  Any'ow 'e
wasn't exac'ly waitin' for it."
</p>

<p>
"Bolted, I suppose?" said Tony laconically.
</p>

<p>
Bugg nodded.  "Run like a stag, sir.  I didn't
go after 'im, not far: I reckoned you might be wantin'
me 'ere."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'd better be getting into the house,"
said Tony.  "We shall have some of the neighbours
out in a minute.  They are not used to these little
scuffles in Hampstead."
</p>

<p>
Even as he spoke one of the front gates clicked,
and an elderly gentleman in carpet slippers and a
purple dressing-gown appeared on the pavement.
He was clutching a poker in his right hand, and he
seemed to be in a state of considerable agitation.
</p>

<p>
On seeing the small group he came to an abrupt
halt, and drew back his weapon ready for instant
action.
</p>

<p>
"What has happened?" he demanded shrilly.  "I
insist upon knowing what has happened."
</p>

<p>
With a disarming smile Tony advanced towards
him.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do?" he said pleasantly.  "I am
Sir Antony Conway of Goodman's Rest."
</p>

<p>
The elderly gentleman's harassed face changed at
once to that affable expression which all respectable
Englishmen assume in the presence of rank and
wealth.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed&mdash;indeed, sir," he observed.  "I am
delighted to meet you.  Perhaps you can inform me
what has occurred.  I was aroused from my sleep
by the sound of firearms&mdash;firearms in Hampstead&mdash;sir!"
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Tony; "it's disgraceful, isn't
it&mdash;considering the rates we have to pay?"  He made
a gesture towards the car.  "I am afraid I can't
tell you very much.  I was driving my cousin back
from the theatre, and when we pulled up we ran right
into what looked like a Corsican vendetta.  I tried to
interfere, and somebody hit me in the mouth for my
pains.  Then I think they must have heard you
coming, because they all cleared out quite suddenly."
</p>

<p>
The elderly gentleman drew himself up into an
almost truculent attitude.
</p>

<p>
"It is fortunate that I was awakened in time," he
said.  "Had I been a sound sleeper&mdash;"  He paused
as though words were inadequate to convey the
catastrophe that might have ensued.  "All the
same," he added with true British indignation, "it's
perfectly scandalous that such things should be
allowed to take place in a respectable neighbourhood
like this.  I shall certainly complain to the police
the first thing in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do," said Tony, "only look here, I mustn't
keep you standing about any longer or you will
be catching cold.  That would be a poor return for
saving my life, wouldn't it?"
</p>

<p>
He wrung the old gentleman's hand warmly, and
the latter, who by this time had apparently begun to
believe that he had really achieved some desperate
feat of heroism, strutted back up his garden path with
the poker swinging fiercely in his hand.
</p>

<p>
Tony turned to the others.  "Come along," he
said.  "Let's get in before any more of our rescuers
arrive."
</p>

<p>
Bugg had left the front door of Mrs. Spalding's
house open, and they made their way straight into
the little sitting-room, where the gas was burning
cheerfully, and a tray of whisky and soda had been
set out on the table.
</p>

<p>
Tony inspected the latter with an approving eye.
</p>

<p>
"You are picking up the English language very
quickly, Isabel," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
She smiled happily.  "I asked Mrs. Spalding to
get it for me," she said.  "I know that men like to
drink at funny times&mdash;at least all father's friends
used to."  She pulled up an easy-chair to the table.
"Now you have got to sit down and help yourself,"
she added.  "I am going to get some warm water
and bathe your mouth.  It's dreadfully cut."
</p>

<p>
Tony started to protest, but she had already left
the room, and by the time he had mixed and
despatched a very welcome peg, she was back again with
a small steaming basin and some soft handkerchiefs.
</p>

<p>
He again attempted to raise some objection, but
with a pretty imperiousness she insisted on his lying
back in the chair.  Then bending over him she
tenderly bathed and dried his cut lips, performing the
operation with the gentleness and skill of a properly
trained nurse.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you're right after all about the Royal
blood," he said, sitting up and inspecting himself
carefully in a hand-glass.  "I doubt if any genuine
queen could have so many useful accomplishments."
</p>

<p>
"I have never been allowed to do anything for
anybody yet," said Isabel contentedly.  "I have got
a lot of lost time to make up."
</p>

<p>
Tony took her hands, which she now surrendered
to him without any trace of the slight embarrassment
that had formerly marked their relationship.
</p>

<p>
"You are only just beginning life, Isabel," he said.
"You have all the advantage of being born suddenly
at eighteen.  It's much the nicest arrangement,
really, because no intelligent person ever enjoys their
childhood or schooldays."  He released her hands,
and glanced across at the clock on the mantelpiece.
"It's time you went to bed," he added.  "We'll
talk about our adventure in the morning.  One
should always have a good night's rest after shooting
off anybody's ear.  It steadies the nerves."
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Isabel obediently.  "I don't
suppose they will try again to-night, do you?"
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "No," he replied; "otherwise
I would stay here and sleep on the mat."  He
took up his hat off the table.  "Try and get packed
by eleven if you can manage it.  I will come round
and call for you with the Peugot: your things will just
go nicely into the back."  He paused.  "Good-night,
Isabel, dear."
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him with that frank, trustful
smile of hers.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, Tony, dear," she said.
</p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
It was exactly a quarter to one the next day, when
the second curate at St. Peter's, Eaton Square, whose
mind was full of a sermon that he was composing,
stepped carelessly off the pavement into the roadway.
This rash act very nearly ended any chances of his
becoming a bishop, for a large travel-stained car that
was coming along Holbein Place at a considerable
speed, only just swerved out of his path by the
fraction of an inch.  With an exclamation that sounded
extraordinarily like "dammit" the curate leaped
back on to the pavement, and turning down Chester
Square, the car pulled up in front of Lady Jocelyn's.
</p>

<p>
Tony and Isabel stepped out, and with a certain
air of satisfaction the former glanced round the
comparatively deserted landscape.
</p>

<p>
"I think we have baffled them, Isabel," he said,
"unless that curate was a spy."
</p>

<p>
Isabel laughed.  "He was very nearly a corpse,"
she remarked.
</p>

<p>
The door of the house opened, emitting two of
Lady Jocelyn's trim maids, who were evidently
expecting their arrival.  Tony assisted them to
collect the luggage and carry it into the house, and
then following one of them upstairs, he and Isabel
were ushered into the drawing-room, where Lady
Jocelyn was waiting to receive them.
</p>

<p>
"This is Isabel, Aunt Fanny," he said.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn took in the rightful Queen of Livadia
with one of her shrewd, kindly glances.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she said, "you are very pretty.
Come and sit down."
</p>

<p>
Isabel, smiling happily, seated herself on the sofa
beside her hostess, while Tony established himself
on the hearth-rug in front of the fireplace.
</p>

<p>
"She is an improved edition of Molly Monk," he
observed contentedly; "and Molly is supposed to be
one of the prettiest girls in London."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to be nice-looking," said Lady Jocelyn,
patting Isabel's hand.  "Your father was a
splendidly handsome man before he took to drink.  I
remember the portraits of him they used to stick up
in Portriga, whenever Pedro's father was more than
usually unpopular."  She turned to Tony.  "I am
thankful that you have got her here safely," she
added.  "I stayed awake quite a long time last night
wondering if you were having your throats cut."
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed.  "No," he said; "it was only my
lip, and Isabel patched it up very nicely."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn put on her tortoise-shell spectacles,
and inspected him gently.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Tony," she said, "now I come to look
at you I can see that you are a little out of drawing.
I was so interested in Isabel I never noticed it before."
</p>

<p>
"It's only temporary," said Tony.  "My beauty
will return."  He glanced at the clock, and then
pulled up an easy-chair.  "I will tell you the whole
story if you like, Aunt Fanny.  There is just time
before lunch, and it always gives me an appetite to
talk about myself."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

&quot;I will tell you the whole story if you like, Aunt Fanny.

appetite to talk about myself.&quot; Lady Jocelyn nodded.  
&quot;Go on, Tony,&quot; she said encouragingly.  &quot;We have

</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn nodded.  "Go on, Tony," she said,
encouragingly.  "We have plenty of food in the
house."
</p>

<p>
There is something rather effective about a really
incongruous atmosphere, and described the next
morning, with the solid respectability of Chester
Square as a background, the midnight battle of
Latimer Lane seemed to gain rather than lose in
vividness.  Tony told it with what for him was a
really praiseworthy restraint and directness, and he
had just got to the end when the door opened and the
parlour-maid announced that lunch was ready.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn rose from the sofa.  "Let us go
and have something to eat," she said.  "I feel
absolutely in need of support.  Your society has
always been stimulating, Tony; but since you have
adopted a profession I find it almost overwhelming."
</p>

<p>
She put her arm through Isabel's, and they made
their way down to the dining-room where a dainty
little lunch was waiting their attention.  For a few
minutes the conversation took a briskly gastronomic
trend, and then, having dismissed the parlour-maid
Lady Jocelyn turned to Tony.
</p>

<p>
"You can go on," she said.  "I feel stronger now."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know that there's very much more to
tell," said Tony.  "I had to explain it all to Guy
who was very hard and unsympathetic.  He said it
served me right for taking Isabel to the Empire, and
that it was only through the mercy of Heaven we were
both not wanted for murder.  I think he must have
meant Harrod, but he said Heaven."
</p>

<p>
"They are not at all alive," replied Lady Jocelyn,
"at least I hope not.  I should hate to spend eternity
in Harrod's."  She paused.  "I wonder if there is any
chance of your having been followed this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so," said Tony.  "They probably
watched us start, but I took a little tour round
Barnet and Hertford before coming here.  We
didn't see any one following us&mdash;did we, Isabel?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head.  "I don't think Da Freitas
would try," she said, "not if he has seen you drive.
He never wastes his time upon impossibilities."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn laughed.  "My dear," she said
gently; "you mustn't make jokes if you want to be
taken for a genuine queen.  Joking went out of
fashion with Charles the Second.  Nowadays no
Royalty has any sense of humour; indeed in Germany
it's regarded as a legal bar to the throne."  She
turned back to Tony.  "Have you heard from your
captain yet?"
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "I had a wire this morning.  He
says the <i>Betty</i> can be ready for sea any time after
Thursday."
</p>

<p>
"That's the best of being a ship," observed Lady
Jocelyn a little enviously.  "One has only to paint
oneself and take in some food and one's ready to go
anywhere.  I have to buy clothes, and make my will,
and invent some story that will satisfy my brother-in-law
the Dean.  I promised to go and stay with him
next month: and it will have to be a good story,
because Deans are rather clever at that sort of thing
themselves."
</p>

<p>
"I think it's so kind of you to come with us,"
observed Isabel simply.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said Lady Jocelyn, "I couldn't
possibly allow you to go away alone on the <i>Betty</i>
with Tony and Guy.  It would be so bad for the
morals of the captain."  She pressed the electric
bell.  "By the way, Tony&mdash;is Guy coming, and
have you decided yet where you are going to take
us?"
</p>

<p>
"Guy's coming all right," replied Tony.  "He has
gone to the Stores this morning to look through
their patent life-saving waistcoats."  He helped
himself to a glass of Hock.  "I thought we might try
Buenos Ayres, Aunt Fanny.  It's just the right time
of year."
</p>

<p>
"I have no objection," said Lady Jocelyn.  "I
don't know much about it except that you pronounce
it wrong, Tony."
</p>

<p>
"It's quite a nice place, I believe," said Tony.
"They buy all our best race-horses."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief interval while the parlour-maid,
who had just come in, cleared away their plates,
and presented them with a fresh course.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't a great number of race-horses to dispose
of," observed Lady Jocelyn, when the girl had
again withdrawn, "but all the same I shall be very
pleased to go to Buenos Ayres.  When do you
propose to start?"
</p>

<p>
"Whenever you like," said Tony generously.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn reflected for a moment.  "I think I
could be ready by to-day week.  We oughtn't to be
longer than we can help or Da Freitas may find out
where you have hidden Isabel."
</p>

<p>
"To-day week it shall be," said Tony.  "I will
send Simmons a wire to have everything ready, and
then we can all motor down in the Rolls and start
straight away."
</p>

<p>
"And in the meantime," observed Lady Jocelyn,
"I think it would be wiser if you didn't come here at
all, Tony.  They are sure to keep a pretty close eye
on you, and you might be followed in spite of all your
precautions.  I am not nervous, but we don't want
to have Isabel shooting people on the doorstep.  It
would upset the maids so."
</p>

<p>
"I expect you're right, Aunt Fanny," said Tony a
little sadly, "but it will be very unpleasant.  I have
got used to Isabel now, and I hate changing my
habits."
</p>

<p>
"It will be quite good for you," returned Lady
Jocelyn firmly.  "You are so accustomed to having
everything you want in life it must become positively
monotonous."  She turned to Isabel.  "You can
always talk to Tony on the telephone, you know,
when you get bored with an old woman's society."
</p>

<p>
Isabel smiled.  "I don't think I shall wait for
that," she said, "or we might never talk at all."

CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
IMPENDING EVENTS
</h3>

<p>
"There's a letter for you," said Guy, "from
Livadia."
</p>

<p>
Tony walked to his place at the breakfast table
and picked up the missive in question which was
propped against the Times beside his plate.
</p>

<p>
"It's from Jimmy," he observed tranquilly.
"How exciting!"
</p>

<p>
He opened the envelope and took out the contents&mdash;a
large sheet of thin paper covered on both sides
with a small neat handwriting.  Sitting down in his
chair he spread it out in front of him.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
  GARAGE ANGLAIS,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRAÇA D. PORTO.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portriga.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
MY DEAR TONY:
</p>

<p>
It was very nice and unexpected of you to answer my
letter&mdash;especially within three months of your having
received it.  You must be getting quite energetic in your
old age, or is it only due to the influence of "the young
and beautiful friend who takes a morbid interest in
Livadian politics?"  Anyhow, it's comforting to know
that you're still alive, and that you still have young and
beautiful friends.  I was half afraid that I was the last of
them.
</p>

<p>
Now with regard to your questions.  The only thing
that seems pretty certain about the future here is that
there's going to be a Hell of a dust up before long.  It's
an open secret that the Royalists are plotting all over
the place, and that they've got a good part of the officers
in the army with them.  Down in the south, however,
there seems to be a strong party that's in favour of the
other branch&mdash;the descendants of that drunken scoundrel
Don Francisco&mdash;whoever they happen to be.  Personally
I can't say I take much interest in any of them.  Apart
from my garage, I think the best thing for Europe would
be if the whole damn lot cut each other's throats.  I
except the old President, who is not half a bad sort&mdash;and
has a very pretty taste in cigars and champagne.  He is
all right, however, because I know he has a good parcel
tucked away somewhere, and means to do a bunk
directly things get too hot.  If I were you I should tell
your young and beautiful friend to give up taking an
interest in Livadian politics and start keeping
rattlesnakes.  It's a much more healthy and profitable hobby.
</p>

<p>
I have had one stroke of luck.  I have managed to
palm off my business here on a local syndicate for a couple
of thou., and am now employed as Managing Director at
£500 a year and commission.  "Commission" in Portriga
means whatever you can cheat out of the customers or
steal from your employers.  So far I am doing nicely at
both, thank you, but I don't expect it will last long.
Another revolution of course would bust us up altogether,
because the first thing that would happen would be that
both sides would come down and snaffle our cars.  So I
am just making an honest living while the sun shines,
and leaving the rest to Prov.
</p>

<p>
You are three sorts of a brick to think out that job in
Piccadilly, but as it stands it's rather too one-sided an
arrangement.  I couldn't take it unless I was in a position
to shove in a little of my own money too.  Practically
all I've got at present would have to go to my dear
creditors, who have been so patient and long-suffering&mdash;I
don't think!&mdash;God bless 'em.  If you will keep it open
for say, another year&mdash;by which time I ought to have
swindled the Garage Anglais out of quite a decent sum&mdash;I
shall be only too delighted to come back and wipe the
floor with you at billiards as often as you like.  Your
notion that you can beat me is one of the most pathetic
instances of monomania I ever came across.
</p>

<p>
Remember me to Guy, who I suppose is as frivolous as
ever, and give my love to any of the old crowd who are
still knocking around.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Yours ever,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JIMMY.<br />
</p>

<p>
Given from our place of hiding this third day of the
fifth month in the second year of our exile.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Tony read this letter through and then tossed it
across to Guy, who perused it in turn between
mouthfuls of egg and bacon.
</p>

<p>
"His troubles don't seem to have sobered him down
at all," he observed rather disapprovingly.
</p>

<p>
"I hope not," said Tony.  "A sobered down
Jimmy would be a lamentable object&mdash;something like
an archangel with his wings clipped."
</p>

<p>
"What he says is true enough, I suppose,"
pursued Guy.  "At least it only confirms what
Congosta told us."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "Things are on the move all
right," he remarked complacently.  "I am pretty sure
Da Freitas meant to press the button just as soon
as the wedding was over.  He must be tearing his
back hair over this hitch in the programme."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad we have got Isabel away from the
Spaldings," observed Guy, handing back the letter,
"I shan't feel really easy in my mind though, until
she is on board the <i>Betty</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it won't be long now," said Tony, "and
anyway she is pretty safe at Chester Square.  Aunt
Fanny is keeping her tight to the house, and so far
they haven't seen a sign of any one hanging about.  I
really think we handed 'em the dummy all right,
though it doesn't do to be too sure about things
with a gentleman like Da Freitas."
</p>

<p>
"I wish we had some idea what he was up to,"
said Guy.  "There is something very trying about
this uncertainty."
</p>

<p>
"I have hopes of Molly," replied Tony, pouring
himself out a second cup of tea in an absent-minded
fashion.  "She rang me up yesterday while I was
out, and left a message that I was to come and see
her this morning without fail."  He took a meditative
sip, and then set down the cup.  "It's about
time we heard something from Congosta too," he
added.
</p>

<p>
Guy shrugged his shoulders.  "I shouldn't put
any faith in him.  He is probably playing his own
game just as much as Da Freitas is."
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at him sadly.  "You get more cynical
every day, Guy.  I believe in Congosta.  No man
could have such a beautiful faith in the British
Aristocracy unless there was some good in him."  He
pushed back his chair and rose from the table.
"I'm off to see Molly anyway," he added.  "I've a
feeling that she has something exciting to tell us,
and a certain amount of excitement has become
necessary to my system.  I can't get my afternoon
sleep without it."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would try to be a little more serious,"
answered Guy in a fretful voice.
</p>

<p>
Tony paused at the door.  "I do try," he said
apologetically, "but it's very difficult for a beginner."
</p>

<p>
It was just a quarter past ten when Tony arrived
outside Basil Mansions, the big block of flats where
Molly lived.  He caught sight of a clock as he
pulled up the car, and it suddenly struck him that in
spite of the urgency of Molly's message, it was still
rather early to disturb her slumbers.  He hesitated
for a moment, and then decided to fill in a little time
by motoring on to the R.A.C. and calling for his
letters.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the several clubs to which he belonged the
latter was the one at which he was accustomed to
receive the largest number of communications.  The
majority of them were trade circulars from motor
firms, and it was his custom to drop in at least twice
a week and commit them to the hall porter's
waste-paper basket.
</p>

<p>
Putting in his clutch he continued his journey,
and was just rounding the corner of Pall Mall, when
he suddenly became aware of the immaculately
dressed figure of his cousin Henry striding briskly
along the pavement towards him in the direction of
Whitehall.  The encounter was too sudden to admit
of any strategy, so with a graceful resignation to
fate he brought the car to a halt.
</p>

<p>
Henry came up with a look of surprise upon his face.
</p>

<p>
"One doesn't often see you about as early as this,"
he observed.
</p>

<p>
"You will in future," said Tony.  "I have turned
over a new leaf.  I find that all our successful
statesmen have been early risers."
</p>

<p>
"I am pleased to hear it," said Henry heartily.
"I always thought that if you ever took up politics
it would make all the difference to you."
</p>

<p>
"It has," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get that White Book about the Patagonia
boundary dispute?" inquired his cousin.
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "I did," he said.  "I haven't had
time to read it all yet, but it seems most interesting.
Such good print too."
</p>

<p>
"They get them up very well," said Henry.  "I
will send you round some more as soon as you have
gone through that.  There is nothing like a thorough
grounding before you start work."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would," replied Tony.  "I was half
thinking of running across to South America in the
<i>Betty</i> with Guy, and looking into things myself for a
few weeks.  I should like to have some nice interesting
reading for the voyage."
</p>

<p>
Henry looked at him in surprised approval.  "I
think that's a very good idea," he said.  "Laura will
be extremely pleased when I tell her, because it shows
that you are taking the matter seriously."  He pulled
out a little tablet from his waistcoat pocket and made
a note in pencil.  "I will see if I can get you a few
letters of introduction to some of our people over
there.  I shall say of course that you are just taking
a voyage for your health."
</p>

<p>
"That's about right," said Tony.  "Thanks so
much.  I must be trotting now, or I shall be late for
an appointment."
</p>

<p>
He waved a good-bye and started off the car again,
while Henry, putting back his memorandum tablet,
continued his way to the Home Office.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, having disposed of the motor
circulars and having restored his energies with a
brandy and soda, Tony set out again for Basil Mansions.
It was still only eleven o'clock, but Claudine,
who answered the bell, informed him that Molly was
already up and awaiting his arrival in the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
He found her as usual sitting at the piano, practising
over a song.  She spun round on the stool at his
entrance, and then jumped up with both her hands
outstretched.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Tony," she exclaimed, "I am so glad you
have come."
</p>

<p>
He waited until Claudine had closed the door,
and then kissed her carefully on the curve of her
cheek.
</p>

<p>
"I should have been here long before, Molly," he
said, "but I was afraid of waking you up.  A good
night's rest is so essential to brain-workers."
</p>

<p>
"I have been up ages," she replied.  "I can never
sleep when I am excited or worried&mdash;at least not
after nine o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"What's worrying you?" he asked, settling
himself on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
She sat down beside him.  "It's Peter," she said.
"He was here yesterday&mdash;yesterday afternoon.  I
rang you up directly he had gone."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" inquired Tony.
</p>

<p>
Molly took a deep breath.  "He had come to say
good-bye."
</p>

<p>
Tony sat up.  "What?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Molly nodded her head.  "He didn't admit it in
so many words, but that's what it came to."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"He must have more nerve than I gave him credit
for," said Tony slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't mean good-bye altogether," said
Molly with a little laugh.  "That isn't Peter's idea
at all."  She jumped up from the sofa, and crossing
to the writing-table in the corner opened the drawer
and took out something from inside.  "Look at
this," she said.
</p>

<p>
"This," was a half sheet of stiff note-paper
stamped in gold with the Royal Livadian arms, and
bearing two or three straggling lines of writing, at
the bottom of which sprawled a large irregular
signature.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-281"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-281.jpg" alt="Signature--Pedro R." />
<br />
Signature&mdash;Pedro R.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Tony examined it with interest.  "It looks very
impressive," he said.  "What's it all about?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a sort of pass," said Molly calmly, "like one
gets for a theatre, you know.  It means 'do
whatever the bearer wishes without asking any
questions.'"  She took it back from him and slipped
it into the envelope which she was holding in her
hand.  "That would take me anywhere I pleased
in Livadia if Peter was king."
</p>

<p>
"But what's the good of it now?" asked Tony.
"Why has he given it you?"
</p>

<p>
Molly crossed to the writing-table, and putting
the envelope back, shut the door and locked it.
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you exactly what happened," she said,
coming back and re-seating herself on the sofa.
"Peter rolled up here about five o'clock yesterday
in a taxi&mdash;not in his car&mdash;just in an ordinary taxi.
I guessed there was trouble because when he does
that it always means that he doesn't want Da Freitas
to find out where he's been.  Well, I gave him a
drink, and he sat and talked for a bit in his ordinary
way, but all the time I could see that there was
something at the back of his mind&mdash;something he didn't
quite know how to say.  At last he managed to get it
out.  He wanted to know if I would trust him.  If
he had to go away suddenly, or if anything happened
which made it impossible for him to see me for a
little while, would I still believe that I was the only
person in the world he really cared about?  I
pretended to be very surprised and asked what he
expected to happen, but he wouldn't admit that
there was anything definite or certain.  He talked
vaguely about a king not being his own master, and
that he never knew from day to day when a revolution
mightn't break out in Livadia and that if it did
his place would be at the head of his people.  Of
course coming from Peter it was all the silliest sort
of poppycock, and any one who wasn't a born idiot
could have seen that he was keeping something back.
However, I let him think that I swallowed it all,
and after a bit he lugged out this paper and explained
what it was.  He said that if by any chance he was
called away to Livadia quite suddenly, the first thing
he should do, as soon as it was possible, would be to
send for me.  He wanted me to promise that no
matter what had happened I would come out right
away.  I saw that he was in dead earnest and frightfully
excited about it, so of course I said I would, and
that seemed to quiet him down.  Anyhow, he didn't
talk any more about it, but I'm as certain as I am that
I'm sitting here that something's going to happen,
Tony, and damn soon too.  You see I know Peter
so jolly well."
</p>

<p>
"It looks precious like it," agreed Tony
thoughtfully.  "I shouldn't wonder if Da Preitas had
changed his plans.  Perhaps the battle of Latimer
Lane has shaken his nerve, and he means to cut out
the Isabel part of the programme and go straight
ahead."
</p>

<p>
"The battle of what?" demanded Molly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I forgot you didn't know about it," said
Tony.  "We have been having all sorts of quiet fun
of our own up at Hampstead."  He paused for a
moment to light himself a cigarette.  "There's
Jimmy's letter too," he added; "only I think I had
better begin by telling you about the battle.  There's
nothing like doing things in their proper order: it's
the secret of all real success in life."
</p>

<p>
"Drive ahead," said Molly encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
Tony, who by this time was becoming quite an
adept in the narrative, again described the spirited
little scuffle outside Mrs. Spalding's house, and the
subsequent transference of Isabel to the more
peaceful atmosphere of Chester Square.  He wound up
with a brief account of how Lady Jocelyn had been
fully taken into their confidence, and of how they had
decided on an immediate trip to South America as
the most promising solution to the problem.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you're right," observed Molly after a
meditative pause.  "If she stops in London that pig
Da Freitas will get hold of her sooner or later, but
I'm awfully sorry you're going, Tony.  There is no
one else that I can even talk to about things."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't be away so very long," said Tony
comfortingly; "and it's much the best thing for you as
well as for us.  Even if they go ahead with the
revolution, Peter isn't likely to marry any one else
at present.  There would be all sorts of international
ructions if he tried to get a wife from another country,
and anyway I shouldn't think the throne of Livadia
was a very dazzling prospect for a foreign princess.
At least, not according to what Jimmy says."
</p>

<p>
"What <i>does</i> he say?" asked Molly.  "Can I see
the letter?"
</p>

<p>
Tony gave it her and, spreading it out on her knee
she bent forward and read it through carefully, her
nicely pencilled eyebrows drawn together in a
thoughtful frown.
</p>

<p>
"It's some letter," she observed, when she had
finished, "but I don't think it gets us much further,
does it?  I know the Livadians must be a set of prize
chumps or they wouldn't want Peter to be their
king."  She folded up the sheet of paper and handed
it back to him.  "I should like to meet Jimmy
some day.  He sounds all right."
</p>

<p>
"He's a dear fellow," said Tony, putting back the
letter in his pocket.  "In a way I like him better than
any one except myself."  He got up from the sofa.
"I shall come and see you again before we go, Molly,"
he added.  "I don't think there is any chance of our
sailing before next Tuesday.  Aunt Fanny has got to
invent a lie that will satisfy the Dean of Ballingford,
and that can't be done in a hurry."
</p>

<p>
"Righto," replied Molly; "and let me know at
once if anything happens, or if there's anything I
can do to help you.  You know I don't care a rap
about the theatre: I would chuck it like a shot if it
was really necessary."
</p>

<p>
Tony took her hands.  "You're the best sportsman
in London, Molly," he said, "and it's a thousand
pities you can't be Queen of Livadia.  You'd make
a Hell of a good job of it."
</p>

<p>
Molly laughed and shrugged her shoulders.  "You
bet I should," she said crisply.  "One can't be six
years in musical comedy without learning how to
treat rotters."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
AN ARTISTIC FORGERY
</h3>

<p>
Spalding drew back the curtains with that slightly
sacerdotal gravity that distinguished all his
professional actions, and then turned towards Tony.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Oliver asked me to inform you, sir, that he
will not be having breakfast with you.  He has to
leave the house early on business."
</p>

<p>
Tony arranged himself more comfortably amongst
the pillows.  "In that case, Spalding," he said,
"I think I shall break my good resolutions, and have
a cup of tea up here.  I can't face the <i>Times</i> and a
poached egg single-handed."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir," observed Spalding, and retiring
deftly to the lower regions, he returned in a few
minutes with a tray containing the desired refreshment,
a couple of letters, and a copy of the <i>Sportsman</i>.
</p>

<p>
Tony took a sip of the tea, lighted himself a cigarette
from the big silver box beside his bed, and then
proceeded to investigate his correspondence.
</p>

<p>
The first letter was of a philanthropic character.
It was from a gentleman named Douglas Gordon,
apparently of Scottish extraction, offering to lend him
any sum from £1,000 to £50,000 on his note of hand
alone.  Laying it one side he picked up the other,
which was addressed in a solid, straightforward
handwriting that he recognized immediately as that
of his skipper&mdash;Captain Simmons of the <i>Betty</i>.
Having as yet had no communication from the yacht,
except for a wire in reply to his, Tony opened it with
some interest.
</p>

<p>
It ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
  May 7th,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S. Y. <i>Betty</i>,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOUTHAMPTON.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
DEAR SIR ANTONY CONWAY:
</p>

<p>
On receipt of your telegram I sent off a reply informing
you that we could be ready for sea any day after Thursday
next.  I trust this duly came to hand, and that it
will not be inconvenient to you to wait until the date in
question.  Not expecting that you would be needing the
<i>Betty</i> for some weeks I had given instructions for one or
two small jobs to be done in the engine-room, and the
same were in hand at the time of writing.
</p>

<p>
In connection with this something rather curious has
happened, which I feel it my duty to bring to your
notice.  Two days ago a gentleman came on board and
asked to see me.  He informed me that his name was
Hemmingway, and that he was a friend of yours.  He
presented one of your cards with instructions written
across it, apparently in your handwriting, that he was
to be allowed to look over the yacht.
</p>

<p>
I showed him round, but in the middle of this I was
called away to speak with the harbour-master with
reference to our moorings.  While I was engaged he
continued his inspection of the vessel, visiting the
engine-room, which at that time was unoccupied.  One of the
crew saw him go in, but knowing that I had been showing
him over the ship, didn't attach any importance to the
matter.
</p>

<p>
Later on, after he had gone ashore, Mr. McEwen
discovered, almost by chance, that an attempt had
apparently been made to tamper with the engines.
Without going into details I may say that if they had been
started as they were, the damage would probably have
been bad enough to keep us in port for at least an extra
week.
</p>

<p>
I have gone fully into the matter, and it seems
impossible that any one else could have been responsible
except this gentleman.  I thought therefore you ought
to hear about it.
</p>

<p>
I can only suppose that knowing nothing of marine
engines he was under the impression that he was performing
some sort of a practical joke.  If so, and you will
excuse my saying so, it seems to me to have been an
uncommon stupid and dangerous one.  I don't suppose he
realizes what would have happened to him if Mr. McEwen
or the second engineer had happened to catch him
in the act.  I fancy he wouldn't have wanted to be
funny with any more engines&mdash;not this side of the grave.
</p>

<p>
Everything is now ready for sea, or will be by the date
I gave you.  The necessary stores are coming on board,
and some extra cases have arrived from Harrod's and
Fortnum and Mason's, which I suppose you have
ordered yourself in London.
</p>

<p>
Hoping that you are keeping well, and with my
respectful regards to yourself and Mr. Oliver,
</p>

<p>
  I have the honour to remain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours truly,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOHN SIMMONS.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Tony laid down the letter on the bed, took a
thoughtful pull or two at his cigarette, and then,
reaching up, pressed the electric bell, which was
answered almost immediately by Spalding.
</p>

<p>
"Has Mr. Oliver gone out yet?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"He left the house a minute or two ago, Sir Antony.
I could perhaps overtake him if you wished it."
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "You had better not try,
Spalding," he said.  "You might drop dead from
heart disease, and that would be very inconvenient."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, sir," assented Spalding gravely.
</p>

<p>
"You can turn on my bath instead," observed
Tony.  "I have to go to Southampton."  He threw
back the bed-clothes and prepared to get out.  "You
might tell Bugg and Jennings that I shall want to see
them as soon as I am dressed," he added.
</p>

<p>
Gathering up the tray, Spalding departed on his
errand, and in a surprisingly short time for him Tony
had completed his toilet, and was descending the
staircase.  As he reached the hall the door at the back
opened, and Bugg appeared on the threshold.  He
came forward in that noiseless fashion which had
won him his famous soubriquet.
</p>

<p>
"Mornin', Sir Ant'ny.  Mr. Spalding says as you
wanted to see me."
</p>

<p>
"That's right, Bugg," said Tony.  "Are you a
good sailor?"
</p>

<p>
"I dunno, sir," observed "Tiger" simply.  "I
ain't never tried&mdash;'cept once at the Welsh 'Arp."
</p>

<p>
"I am told that it can be very rough there at
times," said Tony.  He paused, and looked
thoughtfully at his devoted henchman.  "How would you
like to come to South America on the <i>Betty</i>?" he
inquired.
</p>

<p>
Bugg's blue eyes lit up.  "Not 'arf, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know where it is?"
</p>

<p>
Bugg nodded.  "Yes, sir.  Where they gets the
cocoanuts."
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said Tony.  "Well, we are going
next week, at least I hope so.  Just four of us.  Lady
Jocelyn, Miss Francis, Mr. Oliver and myself.
There's plenty of room on board for you.  Bring a set
of gloves, and we can have some sparring on the way
over.  It's just possible we might be able to fix up
a match in Buenos Ayres and pay the expenses of
the trip.  I believe there are some very rash people
there, and they seem to have plenty of money."
</p>

<p>
Bugg went off, beaming with satisfaction, and
leaving the house, Tony made his way up to the
garage, where he found Jennings surrounded by
various portions of the Hispano's interior.  It was an
exceptional morning when Jennings did not partially
dismantle one or other of his charges.
</p>

<p>
"It had better be the Rolls, sir," he observed
gloomily, on learning that Tony desired to go to
Southampton.  "Both the others are pulling something
sickening.  D'you want me to come too, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it would cheer me up," said Tony.
"Besides, wouldn't you like to see the yacht?"
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please, sir," observed Jennings
indifferently.  "I don't take much stock in boats
meself.  The dry land's good enough for me."
</p>

<p>
Tony seated himself on the running-board of the
Peugot, which was also outside in the yard.  "You
have a happy and contented temperament,
Jennings," he observed.  "I often envy you."
</p>

<p>
Not receiving any reply to this compliment, he
leaned back against the door of the car, and lighting
another cigarette watched Jennings gathering up the
fragments of the Hispano with that cold stoicism of
one unjustly afflicted by the Fates.  He had been
enjoying this pleasant spectacle for several minutes,
when a sudden sound of footsteps attracted his
attention.  A moment later Spalding emerged into
sight round the corner of the bushes and advanced
to where he was sitting.
</p>

<p>
"A gentleman has called, Sir Antony, and wishes
to see you immediately.  I told him that I would
ascertain whether you were at home."
</p>

<p>
"That was very tactful of you, Spalding," said
Tony.  "Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Another foreign gentleman, sir.  A Mr. Congosta."
</p>

<p>
Tony got up at once.  "Oh, yes," he said, "I will
see him certainly.  Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Not knowing the gentleman, Sir Antony, I
thought it best to leave him in the hall."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded his approval.  "We'll be off as soon
as you are ready, Jennings," he said.  "I may stay
the night, so you had better bring your things with
you."
</p>

<p>
Then, accompanied by Spalding, he made his way
back down the drive, and re-entered the front door
outside which an empty taxi was ticking away with
remorseless energy.
</p>

<p>
Señor Congosta, who was seated in one of the big
leather chairs scattered about the hall, rose up at their
entrance.  He bowed to Tony, who at once came
forward and greeted him with a hearty handshake,
while Spalding withdrew discreetly through the door
at the back.
</p>

<p>
"I have been expecting to see or hear from you,"
said Tony in his friendliest manner.  "I have all
sorts of interesting things to talk to you about."
</p>

<p>
Congosta cast a rapid glance round the hall, as if
to make certain that they were alone.
</p>

<p>
"Her Royal Highness?" he demanded quickly.
"She is safe?"
</p>

<p>
"Safe as a church," replied Tony.  "At least she
was when I rang her up last night."
</p>

<p>
"But she is not with you.  She has gone from
where she was living?"
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said Tony reassuringly.  "Da
Freitas found out the address, so I thought a change
of air would be beneficial.  She is staying with some
friends of mine in Chester Square.  They are taking
excellent care of her."
</p>

<p>
A look of relief flashed into the Livadian's face.
</p>

<p>
"It is well," he said, nodding his head.  "I knew
that we might trust you."
</p>

<p>
Tony pulled up a chair.  "Sit down," he said, "and
let's hear your side of the story.  I have been dying
to know what's going on behind the scenes."
</p>

<p>
Congosta glanced swiftly at the clock on the
mantelpiece.  "Many things have happened," he
replied, "but there is not much time for telling them.
In a few minutes I must leave you again."
</p>

<p>
"Well, one can tell quite a lot in a few minutes if
one talks quickly," remarked Tony hopefully.
</p>

<p>
Congosta lowered his voice to a whisper.  "The
hour has struck," he said.  "Even now, while we
stand here, the streets of Portriga may be running
in blood."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" said Tony with interest.  "Whose blood?"
</p>

<p>
Congosta raised his hands in an expressive gesture.
"There will be much fighting.  All over Livadia men
will die for one cause or the other.  It will be the
greatest civil war in the history of my unhappy
country."
</p>

<p>
"That's saying something too, isn't it?" observed
Tony.  He paused to offer his guest a cigar.  "How
do you know all this?" he asked.  "Have you heard
from Colonel Saltero?"
</p>

<p>
"Every day I have news," replied Congosta a
little proudly.  "We have friends in many places&mdash;in
the post-office, among the frontier guards, everywhere!
It is easy to send a cable of which the
government knows nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what has happened&mdash;exactly?" demanded Tony.
</p>

<p>
Congosta took a long breath.  "Da Freitas has
given the signal.  For three days his followers have
been making ready.  All through the North they
have been arming themselves and collecting together
in the principal towns.  It is the same with our
people in the South."
</p>

<p>
"But how about the Republican government?"
inquired Tony.  "Haven't they anything to say to
these happy gatherings?"
</p>

<p>
"They have said what they could," replied Congosta
grimly.  "Half a dozen of Da Freitas' agents
have been seized and shot in Portriga, and yesterday
they arrested General Carmel da Silva, our chief
supporter and the richest man in Livadia.  It was
with his money that we were making our preparations."
</p>

<p>
"That's a nasty knock," said Tony sympathetically.
"What are you going to do about it?"
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing to do," admitted Congosta with
a fatalistic shrug.  "Fortunately we have a fair
supply of arms and ammunition&mdash;for the rest we must
manage as best we can.  In a few days there will be
many rifles without owners in Livadia."
</p>

<p>
"And how about Pedro and Da Freitas?" demanded
Tony.  "Are they joining in the fun or are
they going to sit tight at Richmond and see what
happens?"
</p>

<p>
Again Congosta glanced at the clock.  "It is
because I want the answer to that question that I
must leave you.  Two days ago Da Freitas bought or
hired Lord Northfield's steam yacht, the <i>Vivid</i>.
She is lying off the Tower Bridge now, and so far as
I know she is ready to sail at any moment.  One of
my men is watching her, but I dare not trust wholly
anybody but myself.  It is necessary that our people
should be informed the very moment that Da Freitas
leaves England."
</p>

<p>
"Then you think he is going?" said Tony.  "You
think he has given up the idea of getting back the
Princess?"
</p>

<p>
Congosta indulged in another shrug of the shoulders.
"I cannot tell.  It may be that the revolution
has come against his will&mdash;that he is unable to
control it longer.  Even in that case I do not think he
will easily give up his idea of the marriage.  It is
one thing to overthrow a government: it is another
to take its place.  It's only as the husband of Don
Francisco's daughter that Southern Livadia could
ever be persuaded to acknowledge Pedro."  He
paused.  "You are quite sure that you were not
followed when you took the Princess away?"
</p>

<p>
"I am never quite sure of anything," said Tony,
"especially with people who purr and smile like Da
Freitas does.  All the same I think we managed to
dodge them.  I took her a twenty-mile run in the car
first, and she has not been outside the house since
she got to Chester Square."
</p>

<p>
"You have done well," observed Congosta with a
kind of stately approval.  "Should our hopes be
fulfilled your name will be honoured for ever in
Livadian history."
</p>

<p>
"That will be jolly," said Tony; and then, as
Congosta gathered up his hat from the table, he
added casually: "You will let me know at once, I
suppose, if there should be any news.  I may possibly
be out of town to-night, but I shall be back in
good time to-morrow.  My cousin, Guy Oliver, will
be here in any case.  You can speak to him as freely
as you would to me."
</p>

<p>
Congosta nodded; and after shaking hands again
warmly in the doorway, entered the taxi, which
disappeared rapidly down the drive.
</p>

<p>
For a moment or two after his visitor had departed
Tony remained wrapped in meditation.  Then crossing
the hall he pressed the electric bell for Spalding.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to Southampton as soon as Jennings is
agreeable," he said.  "You might put some pyjamas
in a bag for me and shove them in the car."
</p>

<p>
Spalding departed on his errand, and walking
thoughtfully to the telephone, Tony asked the girl
at the Exchange for Lady Jocelyn's number.  After
waiting for several minutes, he was informed by a
contemptuous voice that it was engaged, and hanging
up the receiver he sat down at an old oak writing-table
which filled up one of the bay windows.  Then,
selecting a piece of paper and a pencil, he wrote the
following note to Guy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
MY DEAR GUY:
</p>

<p>
I wish you wouldn't get up at such ridiculous hours.
It's a very unhealthy habit, and apart from that you
brush all the dew off the lawn, and leave me without
any one to ask advice from.  I wanted your advice this
morning badly.
</p>

<p>
In the first place when I woke up, I got the enclosed
letter from Captain Simmons.  I don't know how it
strikes you, but it looks fishy to me&mdash;very fishy.  I have
never heard of any one called Hemmingway, and I have
no recollection of writing such instructions on one of my
cards.  Of course I might have done it when I was
slightly intoxicated, but then I haven't been even slightly
intoxicated for quite a long time.  There are one or two
pleasant fools among my friends, but no one I can think
of who would be quite such an idiot as to try and break
up the engines of the <i>Betty</i>.
</p>

<p>
The alternative is what you might call an ugly one&mdash;Da
Freitas!  It hardly seems possible, especially in view
of my other news which I am going to tell you in a
moment, and yet who the devil else could it be?  If he
has really dropped on to our notion of taking Isabel
away, it's a serious business&mdash;so serious that I am going to
motor down to Southampton straight away and find out
all I can.  Of course it isn't the least likely that Da
Freitas would have shown up in the business himself, but
I might get some useful information out of Simmons, and
anyway I can at least make certain that everything will
be all right for us on Thursday.
</p>

<p>
My other news comes from Congosta.  In spite of all
the bitter and unkind things you have said about him,
he turned up here faithfully this morning to report
progress.  It was some report too.  According to him the
whole of Livadia by this time ought to be up to its ankles
in gore.  Things began to move two days ago, and
although there has been nothing in the English papers
yet, the odds are that the entire crowd of them&mdash;Royalists,
Franciscans, and Republicans&mdash;are now pleasantly
and usefully occupied in slitting each other's throats.
</p>

<p>
Of course I asked him at once about Pedro and Da
Freitas.  They haven't left England yet, but it seems
that they have bought Lord Northfield's steam yacht, the
<i>Vivid</i>&mdash;and a beauty she is too&mdash;and that she is lying in
the Thames ready to push off at a moment's notice.
</p>

<p>
I admit that this doesn't look as if they could have had
anything to do with the <i>Betty</i> affair, and yet it would
a devilish odd coincidence if anyone had tried such a
trick.  Besides, who on earth would try it?  Everybody
loves me&mdash;apart from Da Freitas and Jennings.
</p>

<p>
I have told Congosta as much as I thought was good for
him.  He knows that Isabel is now in Chester Square
with some friends of mine, though I haven't given him the
actual number.  He seemed so pleased and contented I
thought it was a pity to drag in anything about our South
American idea in case he didn't approve of it.  Also of
course I haven't said a word to him about Molly.  I
mention this because if anything exciting happens while
I am away, I have told him to roll up and inform you.
</p>

<p>
Jennings has just appeared outside with the car, and is
scowling at me so horribly through the window that I
can't write any more.  You might, however, ring up
Aunt Fanny and Isabel as soon as you come in and give
them my love, and let them know what's happened.  I
tried to get on to them just now, but the girl at the
telephone laughed me to scorn.
</p>

<p>
Your neglected and overworked cousin,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TONY.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Having fastened this up, with Captain Simmons'
letter enclosed, Tony handed it to Spalding with
instructions that he was to give it to Guy as soon as
the latter came in.  Then getting into his coat, he
sauntered out through the porch and took his place
at the wheel of the car, Jennings settling himself
sombrely in the seat alongside.
</p>

<p>
The exact length of the journey from London to
Southampton is stated by the <i>Motor Guide</i> to be
seventy-four and a half miles.  This, however, must
be due to an error of measurement on the part of the
editor, since with an hour for lunch at Basingstoke,
Tony covered the distance in three hours and fifty-two
minutes, a feat which is clearly impossible in view
of the present speed limit of twenty miles an hour.
</p>

<p>
He pulled up at that excellent hotel, the Victoria,
where he engaged a couple of rooms for the night,
and with the aid of a hot bath and a large whisky and
soda, removed such portions of the roadway as had
accumulated outside and inside his person.  Then,
leaving Jennings to perform a similar service to the
car, he lighted a cigar and started off through the
town in the direction of the Docks.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Betty</i> was lying out in the Roads, some little
distance from the shore.  With her graceful lines,
her snowy white paint, and her gleaming brass-work,
she presented as charming a picture as the eye of an
owner could desire to gaze upon.  Tony contemplated
her with pride for a moment or two, and then
availing himself of the services of one of the small
cluster of ancient mariners, who had been hovering
interrogatively round him, he set off in a dinghy,
across the intervening stretch of water.
</p>

<p>
His advent was soon observed on board the yacht,
and by the time he arrived alongside, Captain
Simmons was standing at the head of the accommodation
ladder waiting to receive him.  The skipper, a short,
square-shouldered, grey-bearded man with honest
blue eyes, greeted his employer with a blend of
pleasure and concern.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I <i>am</i> glad to see you, Sir Antony, but why
ever didn't you let me know you were coming?  I'd
have had the gig ashore ready for you."
</p>

<p>
Tony shook hands warmly with him, and then
turned to greet Mr. McEwen, the chief engineer,
who came shambling up from below with a gleam
of welcome showing through a forest of red
whiskers.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like having the gig waiting for me,"
explained Tony.  "It always makes me feel as if I
was Sir Thomas Lipton."
</p>

<p>
They remained chatting for a moment or two, and
then moved off across the deck, Tony stopping to
exchange a word or two with various members of
the crew, who all saluted him with the friendly grin
of old acquaintance.  It was not often that there
was a new hand on board the <i>Betty</i>.
</p>

<p>
Captain Simmons led the way to his own cabin,
where the time honoured ceremony of drinking a
toast to the ensuing season having been duly
discharged, he proceeded to add some further details
to the brief report of his preparations that he had
already sent along by post.
</p>

<p>
"I think you'll find everything nice and shipshape
by Thursday, Sir Antony," he finished with a touch
of self-pride.  "Not knowing exactly where we were
bound for I may have allowed a bit too much margin
on the stores, but then I wasn't expecting those
packages you sent from London."
</p>

<p>
"It's an error in the right dimension," observed
Tony contentedly.  "We are thinking of going to
Buenos Ayres to start with, and I always find the
Atlantic very stimulating to one's appetite."
</p>

<p>
"Buenos Ayres!" repeated the skipper with
interest.  "And a very nice run too, sir."  He
turned to the chief engineer.  "Just about twenty
days out&mdash;eh, Mr. McEwen?"
</p>

<p>
The latter shifted his cigar to the corner of his
mouth, and nodded gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Aye," he remarked; "though it might have been
another tale if we hadna' found out the fule's work
that veesitor friend o' yours was up to in the
engine-room, Sir Antony.'
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Tony: "that's one of the things I
wanted to ask about.  What sort of a person was
he?"
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's pause.
</p>

<p>
"What sort of a person!" repeated the skipper.
"Do you mean that you don't know him&mdash;that you
didn't give him that card?"
</p>

<p>
"I have never heard of him in my life," said Tony
tranquilly.
</p>

<p>
With a strange noise, such as a tiger would
probably make if somebody trod upon his toe,
Mr. McEwen turned to the skipper.
</p>

<p>
"Did I no tell ye that the mon was an impostor?"
he demanded excitedly.
</p>

<p>
Fumbling in his waistcoat pocket, Captain Simmons
produced a dirty and crumpled visiting card,
which he held out to Tony.
</p>

<p>
"It's only a chance that I didn't tear it up," he
observed rather grimly.
</p>

<p>
Tony took the card which, despite its dilapidated
appearance, had every appearance of being one of his
own.  He was just able to make out the following
half obliterated message scribbled across it in pencil.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
  Mr. Hemmingway is a friend of mine.<br />
  Please allow him to look over the <i>Betty</i>.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.C.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I don't wonder it took you in," he said, with
a tinge of admiration.  "It's a most artistic
forgery."
</p>

<p>
Mr. McEwen drew a deep breath.  "My God!"
he said softly; "I'm wishing I'd found him in the
engine-room.  I'd have broken him in twa."
</p>

<p>
"It's a pity you didn't," said Tony.  "I should
probably have been able to recognize one or other of
the bits."  He turned to Captain Simmons.  "What
was he like, and what did he do&mdash;exactly?"
</p>

<p>
The skipper, who was a man of slow speech,
pondered for a moment before replying.
</p>

<p>
"He was right enough to look at in a way&mdash;well
dressed and all that sort of thing.  A youngish,
darkish sort of fellow&mdash;might have had a touch of the
Dago about him, but he spoke English as well as you
or me.  As for what he did&mdash;well, Mr. McEwen can
tell you that best."
</p>

<p>
"I'd had the head off one o' the cylinders," burst
out the Scotchman, "an' there she was put back in
her place, but no screwed down.  What did the
black-hearted Jezebel do, but drop in a spanner, a
nine-inch steel spanner that would ha' jarred the head
o' the cylinder to Gehenna if so be we'd screwed her
doon wi'oot takin' a look inside."
</p>

<p>
"Have you any idea who he was, Sir Antony?"
inquired the skipper anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"I think I know where he came from," replied
Tony.  He got up from his seat, and for a moment or
two stared thoughtfully out of the skipper's port-hole.
</p>

<p>
It seemed evident beyond doubt that the
mysterious "Mr. Hemmingway" could have been none
other than an agent of Da Freitas, and for the first
time since he had light-heartedly entered upon his
adventure Tony felt a sudden slight sense of
misgiving.  There was a touch about this latest effort
of the Marquis that suggested unpleasant depths of
knowledge and resource on that gentleman's part.
It seemed hardly probable that he would have
instigated an attempt upon the <i>Betty's</i> engines,
unless he had a very shrewd idea of the use to which that
vessel was shortly to be put.  If this were so, the
situation was some way from being as simple and safe
as it had previously appeared, and with a sudden
determination Tony resolved to take his companions
into his confidence.
</p>

<p>
"I think you ought to know the facts of the case&mdash;both
of you," he said.  "It's quite on the cards I
might be running you into trouble or even danger,
and I don't think we included that in our agreements,
did we?"
</p>

<p>
The skipper stroked his beard.  "One can't include
everything," he remarked; "eh, Mr. McEwen?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm no sayin' I've any great objection to eether,"
observed the latter cautiously; "not in good company."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you shall hear," said Tony; "and then you
can judge for yourselves."
</p>

<p>
In as few words as possible he gave them a brief
outline of the situation, starting from his original
meeting with Isabel in Long Acre, and bringing the
story down to Congosta's visit to Hampstead that
morning.  As a convincing narrative it gained rather
than lost by this compression, for the mere facts,
however crudely stated, had a dramatic grip about
them that needed no embellishment or elaboration.
</p>

<p>
Both the skipper and Mr. McEwen listened to him
with silent attention.  It was a story which any one
might have been pardoned for receiving with a
certain amount of surprise or even incredulity, but
neither of their faces showed any trace of their
natural emotions.  On the contrary they appeared to
accept the entire narrative as though it were the sort
of thing that might reasonably be expected to happen
to any yacht owner of average experience.
</p>

<p>
It was Mr. McEwen who was the first to break the
ensuing silence.
</p>

<p>
"I'm thinkin' that ye've done a guid act," he said
gravely.  "'Tis no business for a young lassie to be
stuck up on a throne over a parcel o' murderin'
Dagoes."
</p>

<p>
Captain Simmons nodded his assent.  "You can
rest your mind easy about the yacht, Sir Antony.
There'll be no one else come on board&mdash;not till you
arrive yourself."
</p>

<p>
"How about the crew?" suggested Tony.  "Ought
they to be told anything?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm inclined to think it would be injudeecious,"
put in Mr. McEwen.  "Not that they would be
makin' any deeficulties&mdash;they would gae to Hell to
oblige you, Sir Antony&mdash;but mebbe 'twould gie 'em
a sense o' their own importance that's no desirable
in a crew.  What do you say, Captain Simmons?"
</p>

<p>
Again the skipper nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that all seems satisfactory enough,"
observed Tony cheerfully.  "I am sure I am very
much obliged to you both."  He poured himself out
another drink and lifted the glass.  "Here's to the
voyage," he said, "and may every owner have as
sporting a lot of officers as I've got."
</p>

<p>
"Here's to the voyage, sir," said Captain Simmons,
following his example, "and proud and glad
to be of any assistance to you."
</p>

<p>
Very gravely Mr. McEwen reached for the whisky
bottle.  "Here's to the voyage, gentlemen," he
repeated, "and God send that we meet the mon who
put that spanner in my cylinder."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was close on eight o'clock by the time Tony
returned to the hotel.  He had some dinner in the
big, sparsely populated restaurant, and then sending
out a message by the waiter to Jennings, invited
that sunny-souled mechanic to come up and play
him a game of snooker in the billiard-room.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of backing losers, snooker was
Jennings' only human weakness, and on occasions
when he and Tony were away together at a hotel he
would so far relax his dignity as to oblige his
employer in this unprofessional fashion.  They played
two games, both of which Jennings won&mdash;a circumstance
which caused him so much satisfaction that
he received Tony's instructions to have the car ready
at eleven the next morning with what only just
escaped being an amiable bow.
</p>

<p>
Despite the somewhat disquieting manner in
which his suspicions about the attempt on the <i>Betty</i>
had been confirmed, Tony managed to pass a very
comfortable night.  He dressed himself leisurely in
the morning and strolled down to the dining-room
about ten o'clock, where he instructed the waiter
to bring him some China tea and a grilled sole.
</p>

<p>
A copy of the <i>Daily Mail</i> was lying on the table
beside his plate, and in the casual fashion of one who
is waiting for breakfast he opened it out in front of
him at the centre page.  As he did so a series of bold,
heavily-leaded headlines leaped into view that
brought an involuntary exclamation from his lips.
</p>

<p class="t3">
  REVOLUTION IN LIVADIA<br />
<br />
  FIERCE FIGHTING AT PORTRIGA<br />
<br />
  REPORTED FLIGHT OF PRESIDENT<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In a second the grilled sole and everything else
had vanished out of his mind and he was eagerly
scanning the following announcement.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By a cable from Paris received shortly before going
to press, we learn that yesterday evening a revolution
broke out in Livadia, which appears already to have
attained wide-spread proportions.  So far, information
is scanty, for the telegraph wires over the frontier have
been cut, and the cable station at Portriga is in the hands
of one or other of the belligerents.
</p>

<p>
It appears, however, that the revolt started simultaneously
in the neighbourhood of Vanessa and also in the
Capital.  At both places the Royal Standard was raised
by a strong party of King Pedro's adherents, and in both
instances the Republican government seem to have been
taken more or less by surprise.  Vanessa is said to be
entirely in the hands of the Royalists, who have also
succeeded in occupying the greater part of Portriga.
</p>

<p>
The situation is complicated by another revolt in the
South, where the partisans of the late Don Francisco,
the Pretender, have also seized the opportunity to assert
their claims.  A strong force, under the leadership of
General Almaida, is reported to be marching on the
Capital, where the Republicans and the Royalists are
still engaged in bitter and sanguinary street fighting.  It
is rumoured that the President has already left the
country.
</p>

<p>
From inquiries at Richmond we learn that King
Pedro and the Marquis da Freitas are still in England,
but in response to numerous invitations they have so far
declined to issue any statement to the Press.
</p>

<p>
All further details available will be found in the first
edition of <i>The Evening News</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Having read this interesting announcement
through slowly and carefully, Tony laid down the
paper and sat back in his chair.
</p>

<p>
So Congosta had been right!  Underneath all the
rather penny coloured plotting and cheap melodrama
that had surrounded Isabel's story, a savagely real
piece of European history had been silently coming
to fruition.  He had never doubted the fact himself,
but somehow or other those flaming head-lines in the
<i>Mail</i> suddenly brought it home to him with a vivid
reality that had hitherto been wanting.  It was as
if the buttons had come off the foils, and what had
hitherto been an entertaining fencing match had
turned abruptly into a thrilling and dangerous duel.
</p>

<p>
With a pleasing sense of elation he drew up his
chair, and prepared to face the grilled sole that the
waiter was just bringing in.
</p>

<p>
"You might tell my chauffeur," he said, "that we
will start back at half-past ten instead of eleven."
</p>

<p>
The waiter went out with the message, but a couple
of minutes had hardly elapsed before he came back
into the room bearing a telegram upon a small tray.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, sir," he said, "one of the sailors
from your yacht has called with this.  He is waiting
in the hall in case you want him."
</p>

<p>
With a certain feeling of surprise Tony laid down
his knife and fork, and slitting open the buff-coloured
envelope, pulled out its contents.
</p>

<p>
They were brief and distinctly to the point.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Isabel has disappeared; fear the worst; come back
immediately.  GUY.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
A DECOY MESSAGE
</h3>

<p>
Guy must have heard the car turning in at the
drive, for as they drew up in front of the house, he
flung open the door and stepped out to meet them.
He looked white and haggard in the bright morning
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
"You got my wire?" was his first remark.
</p>

<p>
Tony, who was at the wheel, nodded his head, and
climbed stiffly out of his seat.  Hardened as he was
to rapid driving, he felt something like a momentary
reaction now that the return journey had been
accomplished without disaster.
</p>

<p>
"Come into the house, Guy," he said.  "You
look like an advertisement for Sanatogen."
</p>

<p>
They entered the hall, where Tony took off his
coat and threw it across the back of one of the chairs.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said.  "Tell me all about it."
</p>

<p>
"Da Freitas has got hold of Isabel," said Guy,
making an effort to speak quietly.  "She left Chester
Square at nine o'clock this morning, and we have
heard nothing of her since."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief pause.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said Tony.  "How did it happen?"
</p>

<p>
"It was my fault," answered Guy with a sort of
harsh bitterness, "at least very largely it was.  I
spent practically all yesterday with Debenham
trying to fix up about the Stanley estate.  It was
absolutely necessary to get the thing settled before
we left England.  Finally I went back to dinner at
his house, and I didn't get home here till nearly
one-o'clock.  Spalding had left your letter in my
bedroom, but somehow or other&mdash;I was tired out and
half asleep I suppose&mdash;I managed to overlook it,
I had left instructions I wasn't to be waked up till
nine o'clock this morning, and when Spalding came to
call me, there was your letter on the dressing-table."
</p>

<p>
He paused.
</p>

<p>
"Directly I had read it I went down-stairs and rang
up Chester Square.  The housemaid answered the
telephone, and said that Isabel had just left the house,
and that Aunt Fanny was still in bed.  When I asked
if Isabel had mentioned any reason for going out so
early, she said that Spalding had rung up a quarter
of an hour before and said that you wanted Miss
Francis to come over here in a taxi as soon as possible.
Well, of course, I guessed there was something wrong
at once.  I sent for Spalding, and as I expected, he
told me that he hadn't been near the telephone all the
morning.  I was getting really frightened now, so I
told the girl to put me through to Aunt Fanny, who
has got another receiver in her bedroom.  Then it all
came out.  Somebody, who pretended to be Spalding,
had rung up at about twenty to nine and asked
for Isabel.  He had said you wanted her here, and
that she was to take a taxi along as soon as she could
manage it.  Isabel evidently hadn't the faintest
suspicion that it wasn't all right.  Aunt Fanny was
asleep at the time, and she wouldn't allow her to be
waked up.  She had just put on her hat and got into
a taxi that was waiting a little way down the Square,
and that's the very last that any of us have heard
of her."  Guy's voice shook, but with an effort he
managed to control it.  "They've got her, Tony,"
he added despairingly.  "I would have given my
right hand to have stopped it, but what's the good
now?  They've got her, and we shall never see her
again."
</p>

<p>
Tony laid his hand on his cousin's shoulder.  "My
dear old Guy," he said quietly: "it wasn't your fault.
If any one has been to blame, it's me."  He took a
couple of turns across the room and came back to
where Guy was standing.  "Hang it," he said
ruefully.  "I had no idea I was so fond of Isabel."
</p>

<p>
Guy looked up at him with a rather twisted smile.
"I knew you would find it out eventually, Tony," he
said.  "It's a pity it's happened too late."
</p>

<p>
"Too late be damned," observed Tony calmly.
"Even if Da Freitas has got hold of her, do you
imagine I am going to let him keep her?  I know now
that I want Isabel more than anything else in the
world.  I have always been accustomed to have
what I want, and it's a very bad thing to change one's
habits suddenly at my age."
</p>

<p>
Guy made a kind of hopeless gesture with his hands.
"But what can you do?" he demanded.  "You have
seen the papers this morning&mdash;you know what's
happening in Livadia?  The odds are they will take
her straight over there and marry her to Pedro right
away."
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall go over and fetch her back," replied
Tony firmly.  "I am not going to allow any silly
old-fashioned ideas about the sanctity of marriage
to interfere with my life's happiness."
</p>

<p>
Guy opened his mouth to speak, but he was suddenly
interrupted by the grinding scrunch of a second
motor pulling up abruptly outside the house.
Almost at the same moment the bell rang with a
prolonged violence that echoed up from the basement.
</p>

<p>
"I rather think that must be Congosta," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
He crossed the hall, and pulling back the latch,
opened the front door.
</p>

<p>
The visitor was Señor Congosta, but his most
intimate friends might have been pardoned if for a
moment they had failed to recognize him.  Hatless,
dishevelled, and with a long smear of blood at the
corner of his mouth, he looked as if he had been taking
part in a rather closely contested Irish election.
</p>

<p>
"So!" he observed, drawing himself up and glaring
at Tony, "you have betrayed me."
</p>

<p>
Tony stepped towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly," he said.  "Come along in and sit down."
</p>

<p>
He thrust his arm through the Livadian's, and
before the latter could protest he had brought him to
a chair and practically pushed him into it.  "You
had better have a drink right away," he added.
"You look done to the world.  Get the whisky, will
you, Guy?"
</p>

<p>
Guy started off to do as he was asked, and before
the disgruntled Señor had properly recovered himself
Tony turned back to him with a disarming smile.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry to have been so snappy," he said.  "I
suppose you have just found out about Isabel, and
of course you would think we were
scoundrels&mdash;naturally."
</p>

<p>
With an effort Congosta managed to regain his
power of speech.
</p>

<p>
"You know what has happened?" he demanded
hoarsely.  "You know where she is?"
</p>

<p>
"I have just heard that she was decoyed away from
Chester Square by a false telephone message at nine
o'clock this morning.  For the moment I have no idea
where she is.  If I had I shouldn't be sitting here."
</p>

<p>
"Then you shall know!" gripping the arm of the
chair, Congosta bent forward towards him.  "She
is a drugged and helpless prisoner on the <i>Vivid</i>.
By now she is half-way down the Thames on her way
to Livadia."
</p>

<p>
There was a second's pause, and then Guy
reappeared from the dining-room with the whisky and
soda.
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear that, Guy?" said Tony.  "Señor
Congosta says that Isabel is on board the <i>Vivid</i>, and
that they have already started for Livadia."
</p>

<p>
Guy came up and put down the tray he was carrying.
</p>

<p>
"I knew it," he said hopelessly.  "We shall never
see her again&mdash;never."
</p>

<p>
"And whose fault is that?" demanded Congosta,
striking the arm of the chair with his fist.  "Did
you not promise me that she should be safe?  Did
I not leave the honour of my country in your
hands?"
</p>

<p>
"You did," said Tony, "and we have let you down
with a bump."
</p>

<p>
He splashed some whisky and soda into a glass and
held it out to the Livadian, who sat there glowering
at them both with angry suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Señor," he added persuasively, "drink
that up and you'll feel better.  Whatever else we do,
it's no good quarrelling amongst ourselves."
</p>

<p>
Congosta, who really did appear to be badly in
need of it, gulped off a couple of mouthfuls of the
stimulant, and set down the tumbler.
</p>

<p>
"Now listen to me," said Tony, speaking very
slowly and quietly.  "I admit that things look queer
and I admit that you have every right to feel
suspicious.  But there has been no treachery.  You can
get that idea out of your head right away.  I moved
Isabel to Chester Square because I thought it was
the safest place she could be in.  We took every
precaution, and I haven't the faintest motion how Da
Freitas found out her address.  It has been just as
big a smack in the eye to us as it is to you."
</p>

<p>
Either the drink or else Tony's unwonted earnestness
evidently brought some sort of conviction to the
visitor.  Once again his shattered faith in the British
aristocracy seemed slowly to revive, and rising to
his feet, he bowed stiffly to his two companions.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen!" he said.  "I spoke hastily.  I ask
your pardon."
</p>

<p>
"If there is any apologizing to be done," said Tony,
"it's up to me.  I have underrated Da Freitas all
through in the most fatuous way&mdash;and this is the
result!"
</p>

<p>
Congosta reseated himself.
</p>

<p>
"Please tell me exactly what happened this
morning," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Somebody rang up the house in Chester Square
and pretended to be my butler," answered Tony.
"He said that I wanted Isabel to come here at once
in a taxi.  Unfortunately the lady she is staying with
was still asleep, and instead of waking her up and
asking her advice, Isabel seems to have gone
straight outside and got into a taxi that was waiting
in the Square.  That's the last we have heard
of her."
</p>

<p>
Congosta nodded.  "I can give you the rest of the
story," he said.  "For three days I have rented a
little room close to an empty warehouse opposite to
where the <i>Vivid</i> was lying.  There is a wharf just
below where any one would start from if he wished to
reach the vessel.  Always there is someone in that
room&mdash;I or another&mdash;watching and waiting.  Last
night, late and in the dark, a cart came down with
luggage and packages.  They took them on board,
and I knew then that Da Freitas' plans were ready.
Very early this morning they began to get up steam
on the yacht.  I stayed there, watching from the
window, and at ten o'clock a boat put off with four
men in it.  They were all Livadians&mdash;one I knew well
by sight.  I had seen him at Richmond with Da
Freitas.  When they got to the wharf, they came
ashore and fastened up the boat.  They were
evidently expecting someone, because two of them took
it in turns to watch, while the others went across the
roadway to drink."
</p>

<p>
Congosta paused, and taking out his handkerchief
pressed it against his lip.
</p>

<p>
"Just before midday," he went on, "a big closed
car came quickly along the lane and pulled up at the
wharf.  There was no one about at the moment
except the four sailors.  I saw Pedro open the door
and get out, and then almost before I could realize
what was happening there was my Royal mistress,
drugged, helpless, hardly able to stand&mdash;with the
Count on one side of her and Da Freitas on the
other."
</p>

<p>
He stopped again and took in a long breath.
</p>

<p>
"I think for a little while I was mad.  It would
have been better, far better, if I had not shown
myself.  Then I could have got away quickly and
something might still have been arranged.  But for
the moment I was so full of rage and disappointment
that I did not know what I was doing.  I only
remember running downstairs&mdash;my mind made up
that I would kill Da Freitas.  Then I was amongst
them; and had it been any one else my knife would
have been in his heart before they could have stopped
me.  But I think that black, smiling devil cannot be
surprised.  Even as I flung myself at him, he dragged
the Princess in front of him, and I could not strike
for the fear that I might hurt her.  Then in a
moment I was beaten to the ground.  I fought
bravely&mdash;splendidly, but what could I do against six men?
I must have been stunned by the blow on the head
from behind, for I remember nothing more until I
came to my senses again in the small wide shop across
the street.  Someone had found me lying on the
wharf, and they had carried me in there thinking that
I was dead."
</p>

<p>
Once more he stopped, and reaching out a rather
shaky hand for the tumbler finished off the whisky
and soda.
</p>

<p>
"Are you badly hurt?" asked Guy, who had been
listening to the narrative with a mixture of
amazement and concern.
</p>

<p>
Congosta put his hand to his forehead.  "It is
nothing serious.  Only my head aches very much.
I think they would have killed me if it had not been
for my hat."
</p>

<p>
"Let's have a look," said Tony.  "I know a little
about cracked skulls."
</p>

<p>
He came round to where Congosta was sitting,
and bending over the latter's chair, very carefully
parted the hair at a place where it was matted with
congealed blood.
</p>

<p>
"It's a nasty bump," he said sympathetically;
"but I don't think there is any real damage done.
You must have a very good hatter."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I fetch some hot water and bathe it for
you?" suggested Guy, getting up from his seat.
</p>

<p>
Congosta raised his hand protestingly.  "It will
wait," he said with a certain grimness.  "What we
are speaking of will not."
</p>

<p>
Tony seated himself on the arm of the opposite
chair.  "Go on," he said.  "What happened when
you came round?"
</p>

<p>
"For a little while," continued Congosta, "I
could remember nothing.  Then suddenly it all came
back to me, and somehow the shock seemed to make
me strong again.  The people in the wine shop wished
to send for the police, but I would not let them.
Instead I paid them to get me a taxi.  I had made up
my mind that first I would come to you, and that I
would find out the truth.  I could see from the
window that the yacht had already moved from her
moorings, and I knew that it was now too late for
anything except to warn my friends in Livadia.
That&mdash;and to be revenged upon you, if you had
betrayed me."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.
</p>

<p>
"It's horrible to be so helpless," said Guy with a
sort of groan.  "Is there nothing that we can do?
I suppose there would be no chance of getting them
held up for an hour or two at Southend?"
</p>

<p>
"What for?" asked Tony languidly.
</p>

<p>
"There's&mdash;there's this assault upon Señor Congosta."
</p>

<p>
The latter shook his head.  "It would be useless,"
he said.  "I know well that your government will be
only too pleased that they have gone.  The police
would not be allowed to interfere even if they wished
to."
</p>

<p>
"But we must do something," exclaimed Guy almost
fiercely.
</p>

<p>
Tony got up from his seat.  "I know what I'm
going to do," he said.  "I am going to follow them
to Livadia."
</p>

<p>
For an instant both of them stared at him without speaking.
</p>

<p>
"But how do you expect to get there?" demanded
Congosta incredulously.  "The steamers from England
are stopped, and all the frontier is in the hands
of Da Freitas' soldiers.  No one will be allowed to
enter the country until the Revolution is over."
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't matter to me," said Tony.  "I
have a private yacht of my own."
</p>

<p>
The news seemed to produce a remarkable effect
upon Congosta.
</p>

<p>
"A private yacht!" he repeated, rising abruptly
to his feet.  "And you mean what you say?  You
mean that you will sail for Portriga
now&mdash;immediately&mdash;at once?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, say to-morrow morning," suggested Tony.
"That will give us time to get on board first."
</p>

<p>
By now all Congosta's headache and exhaustion
seemed magically to have vanished.
</p>

<p>
"My friend!" he ejaculated fervently, "my dear
Sir Antony!  You may yet be of the truest service
to my unhappy country."
</p>

<p>
"But look here!" broke in Guy, who had also
risen from his chair and was gazing from one to the
other of them.  "This is all very well, but what on
earth's the use of it?  Even if we got to Portriga you
don't suppose we should have the faintest chance of
being able to do anything!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't like looking too far ahead," said Tony.
"It shows a lack of trust in Providence."
</p>

<p>
Congosta wheeled round excitedly to Guy.  "Señor!"
he exclaimed.  "I assure you that you may
yet save Livadia."  He turned back to Tony.  "You
have seen this morning's paper?  You know the
truth about what has happened?"
</p>

<p>
"I have seen the <i>Daily Mail</i>," said Tony guardedly.
</p>

<p>
"So!  That is right, what they have written, but
there is later news."  He thrust his hand into his
breast pocket, and dragging out some papers, selected
a crumpled cable form, which he opened with shaking
fingers.  "Even now General Almaida is in Portriga.
He holds the whole town south of the river."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that you're in communication with
them?" demanded Guy.  "I thought all the wires
had been cut."
</p>

<p>
"We were not without our preparations," returned
Congosta with a vindictive smile.  "The way is still
open.  It will not be closed so long as General
Almaida is undefeated."
</p>

<p>
"And how long is that likely to be?" asked Tony.
</p>

<p>
Congosta drew himself up.
</p>

<p>
"Señor!" he replied dramatically.  "It rests with you."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Tony encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
"There are two things in which our brave army is
lacking&mdash;ammunition and money.  If we can help
them with these&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "What's the idea&mdash;exactly?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Congosta took a step forward, his dark eyes gleaming
with excitement.  He began to speak in a low,
rapid voice.
</p>

<p>
"A week ago, by the instructions of General
Almaida, I gave an order to one of your English
houses for a supply of cartridges.  The money was
to have been sent to me, and we had arranged a plan
for getting them safely across.  Had the revolution
not broken out they would now be on their way.
As it is&mdash;!" he made a quick expressive gesture with
his hands&mdash;"The money has not come, and even if
I could pay there is no vessel that could take them
to Livadia."
</p>

<p>
He paused for breath.
</p>

<p>
"We haven't a cargo license for the <i>Betty</i>," said
Tony, "but I don't know that it really matters."
</p>

<p>
Congosta came nearer still.  "You will do it,"
he gasped.  "You will lend us this money?  You will
take the cartridges on your yacht?"
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded again.  "Why, of course," he said.
"It's the least I can do after losing Isabel in that
careless fashion."
</p>

<p>
With an exclamation of joy Congosta seized hold
of his hand, and commenced wringing it violently
up and down.
</p>

<p>
"My friend," he exclaimed with tears in his eyes.
"How can I ever thank you?"
</p>

<p>
"But Good Heavens!" interrupted Guy, drawing
in his breath.  "Do you realize what this means?
It's&mdash;it's&mdash;filibustering&mdash;piracy&mdash;buccaneering&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is it?" said Tony&mdash;"what fun!  I have always
wanted to be a buccaneer ever since I was thirteen."  He
disentangled himself with some difficulty from
the clutches of Congosta.  "Don't worry, Guy," he
added, "you needn't be mixed up with it in any way."
</p>

<p>
"What!"  For a moment Guy's indignation rendered
him almost speechless.  "Do you suppose I
am thinking of myself?  Do you imagine I shall
desert you&mdash;now&mdash;at this time?"
</p>

<p>
"There is not the danger that the Señor fancies,"
broke in Congosta with a kind of feverish eagerness.
"Listen!  I will explain!"  He turned to Tony.
"You have heard of Braxa?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so," said Tony regretfully.  "You
see I was educated at Eton."
</p>

<p>
"It is a fishing village&mdash;a small fishing village and
harbour twenty miles south of Portriga.  The
people there are different from most of my countrymen.
They are all fishermen, and they do not concern
themselves much with politics."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds just the sort of quiet and sensible place
one would like to visit," observed Tony.
</p>

<p>
"So!  You understand what I mean!"  Congosta's
excitement became almost painful to witness.  "You
are on a voyage of pleasure!  You come into the
harbour in your yacht.  My people will be expecting
you.  In an hour the cartridges will be on shore, and
then&mdash;" he paused and the same vindictive smile
gathered in his eyes, "there may yet be a little hitch
in the clever plans of the Marquis da Freitas."
</p>

<p>
"It's a great idea," said Tony admiringly.  "So
simple and safe!  Why we needn't even land if we
don't want to."
</p>

<p>
"But what would be the good?" began Guy.
</p>

<p>
He got no further, for he suddenly caught sight of
his cousin's face, as the latter looked round at him,
and its expression dried up the question that he was
about to utter.
</p>

<p>
"These cartridges," inquired Tony, turning back
to Congosta with his previously serene air.  "How
long do you think it would take to get them to
Southampton?"
</p>

<p>
"There need be no delay," replied the Livadian.
"It is only a question of the money.  As soon as they
are paid for I can arrange for them to be sent down
on motor lorry.  They would go to-night."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded approvingly.  "And how about
your message to Livadia?  It won't be an easy thing
to explain.  None of your people have ever heard of
me except Colonel Saltero, and I don't think I
impressed him very favourably."
</p>

<p>
Congosta dismissed the objection with a wave of
his hand.
</p>

<p>
"You may leave that to me," he said.  "I assure
you that before he left England Colonel Saltero was
convinced of your good faith.  I shall arrange that
it is he who will meet you at Braxa to receive the
cartridges."
</p>

<p>
"But won't you be coming with us?" asked Guy.
</p>

<p>
Congosta shook his head.  "I must stay in London,"
he answered regretfully.  "It is General
Almaida's wish.  Should our party win it is necessary
that there should be someone here to obtain
recognition from your government."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," said Tony; "quite so."  He lighted
himself a cigarette, and took a couple of thoughtful
paces up and down the hall.  Guy did not speak
again, but watched him with a strained apprehension
that showed itself visibly in his face.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," said Tony, coming back to where
Congosta was standing.  "Could you get a message
through to any one in Portriga?"
</p>

<p>
Congosta looked faintly surprised.  "I cannot say.
It is possible.  It would depend perhaps upon what
part of the town they were in."  He paused.  "Why
do you wish to know?"
</p>

<p>
"I am a little bit anxious about a friend of mine,"
said Tony frankly.  "He has been running a motor
company in Portriga for the last two years, and from
what he has told me I am afraid that he has made one
or two rather awkward enemies&mdash;business enemies,
you know.  They are not the sort of crowd to miss a
chance like this, and just in case he was in difficulties,
I should like him to know that the <i>Betty</i> was coming
to Braxa.  Then if he wanted to slip out of the
country quietly he could."
</p>

<p>
Congosta accepted the explanation in what
appeared to be perfectly good faith.
</p>

<p>
"I understand," he said.  "You shall give me
your friend's name and address, and then if our
people can reach him you may be sure that he will
get your message."
</p>

<p>
Tony walked across to the writing-table and seated
himself in the chair.
</p>

<p>
"That's good," he said cheerfully.  "One doesn't
like to leave a pal in the lurch&mdash;especially in Livadia."
</p>

<p>
He took a sheet of paper from the case in front
of him, and in his best handwriting copied out the
following address.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
  SEÑOR JAMES DALE,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garage Anglais,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praca D. Porto,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portriga.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I think it would be simplest," he said, "if you
just told him that the <i>Betty</i> was expected at Braxa
in two days' time.  He would probably like to see
me, even if there's nothing the matter."
</p>

<p>
Congosta took the paper and glanced at its contents.
</p>

<p>
"If the thing is possible it shall be done," he
repeated.
</p>

<p>
Tony put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his
cheque book.
</p>

<p>
"And now let's get to work," he observed.  "I
shall be pretty busy if we are going to sail to-morrow
morning, so I think I had better leave the cartridge
business entirely to you.  I will give you an open
cheque on my bank, and you can cash it on your way
back."
</p>

<p>
Congosta nodded his approval.  "That will be the
easiest plan," he said.  "Then I can also make the
arrangements for sending them off."
</p>

<p>
"'Steam yacht <i>Betty</i>, Southampton,' will be enough
address," continued Tony, writing the cheque as he
spoke.  "I will wire my captain instructions to be
on the lookout for them."  He blotted the slip and
handed it to Congosta.  "I don't know what they
will come to," he added; "I have made the cheque
out for four thousand."
</p>

<p>
Congosta gazed with surprised awe at the little
piece of pink paper in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Four thousand pounds?" he repeated slowly.
"But it will not be so much as that!"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Tony, getting up from his
chair.  "Ask for the rest in gold and bring it back
here.  We can take it along with us.  If your people
are as hard up as you say, I daresay a few English
sovereigns will come in useful.  They are a wonderfully
effective weapon with Royalists as a rule."
</p>

<p>
Congosta folded up the cheque reverently, and
put it away in his pocket.  Then he picked up his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Señor!" he exclaimed with a tremble of emotion
in his voice.  "Again I offer you the thanks of my
country.  It is only in England that such splendid
generosity is possible."
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing to thank me for," said Tony
cheerfully.  "It's my own stupidity and carelessness
I'm paying for&mdash;that's all."  He accompanied Congosta
across the hall and opened the front door for
him.  "We shall expect you back here some time
this afternoon," he added.
</p>

<p>
The Livadian nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I shall return as soon as I have arranged about
the cartridges," he said.  "It is best that I should
not send the message until we know for certain what
time you will be able to start."
</p>

<p>
Once more he clasped Tony's hand and shook it
fervently, and then, after giving some instructions
to the driver, he stepped into the waiting taxi, and
was whirled off down the drive.
</p>

<p>
Tony came back into the hall, and closed the door.
As he did so he caught sight of a note lying at the
bottom of the letter-box, and taking it out discovered
that it was addressed to himself.
</p>

<p>
"And now," broke out Guy, who had apparently
been restraining himself with difficulty; "perhaps
you'll tell me if you are really in earnest."
</p>

<p>
Tony slit open the envelope and pulled out its
contents.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I'm in earnest," he answered.  "I was
never so&mdash;"  He paused abruptly, and his lips
screwed themselves up into a sudden low whistle of
amused amazement.  "By Jove, Guy!" he exclaimed;
"look at this!"
</p>

<p>
He held out the sheet of note-paper, and then
thrusting his hands into his pockets, watched his
cousin's face as the latter read through the following
missive.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
MY DEAR SIR ANTONY CONWAY:
</p>

<p>
I much regret that I was unable to find time to say
good-bye to you before leaving England.
</p>

<p>
You have a proverb I believe in your delightful
language to the effect that he laughs loudest who laughs
last.  You will now be able to appreciate its profound
truth.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Always yours sincerely,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DA FREITAS.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
THE ROYAL PASS
</h3>

<p>
Guy read it through and then looked up with a
sort of incredulous bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"When did this come?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Tony shrugged his shoulders.  "My dear Guy&mdash;I
don't know any more about it than you do.  I suppose
someone must have put it in the letter-box while
we were having our pleasant little chat with Congosta."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but&mdash;"  He stared at it again in frowning
uncertainty&mdash;"Good Heavens, Tony!" he exclaimed,
"do you mean to say that Da Freitas took the trouble
and the risk of sending you this while he was
actually&mdash;?"  He broke off as if unable to complete the
sentence.
</p>

<p>
"Looks like it, doesn't it?" said Tony cheerfully.
"My respect for the Marquis increases every
hour&mdash;in fact I'm beginning to feel quite fond of
him."
</p>

<p>
Guy's lips tightened into an expression of restrained
exasperation.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Tony," he began with forced calmness.
"For goodness' sake let's get this thing quite
clear.  Did you really mean what you said to Congosta?"
</p>

<p>
Tony took back Da Freitas' note, and put it
carefully in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"I meant most of it," he replied.  "I am going
down to Southampton to-night, and I shall start for
Livadia the moment the <i>Betty</i> is ready to sail."
</p>

<p>
Guy knew him well enough to understand that for
once he was speaking in absolute sincerity.
</p>

<p>
"You mean to fight then?  You are going to join
this man&mdash;what's his name&mdash;General Almaida?"
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause.
</p>

<p>
"Somehow or other," said Tony, "I am going to
get Isabel back.  It's no good asking me exactly
how I shall do it, because at the present moment I
don't know.  The only thing I have quite made up
my mind about is that I shall either come back with
her, or else I shan't come back at all."  He looked
up smilingly at Guy.  "Now you understand what I
meant when I said I didn't want to drag you into it."
</p>

<p>
A faint flush mounted into Guy's naturally pale
face.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I am a coward, Tony?" he
inquired very deliberately.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," returned Tony.  "Any man who
has a cold bath as you do every morning must be
brave.  Still that's no reason why you should run a
quite unnecessary risk of getting shot&mdash;especially as
you have disapproved of the whole business ever
since the start."
</p>

<p>
"Who could help disapproving of it?" burst out
Guy feelingly.  "It's the maddest and most impossible
affair in which any sane person was ever mixed
up."  He paused as if to recover himself.  "All the
same," he added quickly, "I should like to come
with you, Tony, if you think I could be of any use."
</p>

<p>
Tony patted him approvingly on the shoulder.
"Any use!" he repeated.  "Why, my dear old Guy,
I would rather have you with me than the Seven
Champions of Christendom.  I am sure you would
be a lot more reliable in a really tight corner."
</p>

<p>
"Have you got any sort of a plan at all?" inquired
Guy a little hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've an idea," said Tony.  "It's hardly a
plan yet, but it may be by the time I get back."
</p>

<p>
"You're going out?"
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "I shan't be long, and meanwhile
you can fix up the arrangements here.  In the first
place I want you to get on to Simmons on the
telephone.  You had better ring up the Grand Hotel,
Southampton, and say you're me, and ask them very
prettily and nicely if they'll send round someone to
fetch him from the yacht.  Tell him that we are
coming down to-night or early to-morrow morning&mdash;you
and I and Bugg&mdash;and that he must be ready to
start directly we arrive.  Say that we have changed
our minds about South America and that we are going
to Braxa instead."
</p>

<p>
Guy stepped to the table and made a note of these
instructions.
</p>

<p>
"Anything else?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing more," replied Tony.  "Just see that
Spalding packs our things, and that Jennings has the
car ready&mdash;the Rolls of course.  Any spare time you
have after that I should devote to making your will."
</p>

<p>
He picked up his coat off the chair on which it was
lying.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going to?" asked Guy.
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause while Tony lighted himself
a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to a matinée," he said, "at the Gaiety
Theatre."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Guy stared at him in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"A matinée!" he repeated.  "What on&mdash;"  Then
suddenly light seemed to dawn on him.  "Why, of
course, that girl&mdash;Molly Monk&mdash;I had forgotten
her."  He paused.  "Do you think she can be of
any help?"
</p>

<p>
Tony walked to the door.  "She might lend us a
sheet of note-paper," he said.  "Anyhow I mean to
ask her."
</p>

<p>
If there is one profession in this world more likely
than the rest to induce a certain slight cynicism
with regard to human motives, it is probably that
of being stage door-keeper at the Gaiety Theatre.
When therefore a quarter of an hour later, Tony
presented his card at the open pigeon-hole with a
request that he might see Miss Monk immediately on
a matter of urgent importance, the uniformed gentleman
inside contented himself with a weary smile.
</p>

<p>
"I'll send it up, sir," he remarked, "but between
ourselves it ain't no good.  The Guv'nor don't allow
visitors in the dressin' rooms&mdash;not while the show's
on."
</p>

<p>
Tony, who had been fingering a sovereign, laid it
down beside the card.
</p>

<p>
"What a pity!" he replied thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
At the sight of the gold piece the janitor's world
hardened face lit up with an expression that was
almost beautiful.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take it up meself, sir," he observed hastily,
climbing down from his stool.  "Of course if it's a
matter o' urgent importance&mdash;"  He emerged from
his rabbit hutch, card in hand, and pushing open a
swing-door disappeared from view up a winding flight
of stairs.
</p>

<p>
After a decent interval he returned with the air of
one who has triumphed over great odds.
</p>

<p>
"S'orl right," he remarked in a confidential whisper.
"She's orf now, sir.  You foller me, sir."
</p>

<p>
He conducted Tony up the stairs, to the first landing,
where he tapped cautiously on the second door he
came to.  It was opened at once by a secretive looking
lady, who appeared to be lunching on pins, and at the
same moment Molly's voice remarked with its usual
pleasant distinctness: "If that's you, Tony, come
along in."
</p>

<p>
Complying with the request Tony found himself in
a small, brightly lit apartment, the principal
furniture of which appeared to be a vast mirror, a long
narrow dressing-table, a comfortable easy-chair, and
an inspiriting collection of foamy undergarments,
suspended from a row of pegs.
</p>

<p>
In the chair sat Molly.  She was dressed in the
simple and practical costume of a milkmaid, as
visualized by producers of musical comedy.  It consisted
of a charmingly décolletté creation of white muslin
and blue ribbon, completed by a large "baby" hat, a
skirt that just reached her knees, white silk stockings
and high-heeled shoes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Tony!" she exclaimed; "thank goodness
you've come."  Then turning to the dresser she
added kindly: "You can shove off, Jane.  I want to
talk to him alone."
</p>

<p>
Acting on the hint the lady of the pins withdrew
from the room, and hardly waiting until the door
had closed behind her, Molly jumped up from the
chair.
</p>

<p>
"Have you anything to tell me, Tony?" she
asked in a voice that shook a little with excitement.
"I know nothing yet except what I've seen in the
paper.  I have tried to ring you up twice, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How long have you got now?" inquired Tony.
</p>

<p>
She glanced at the little silver clock on the
dressing-table.
</p>

<p>
"About ten minutes.  Then I have to go on and
sing a song, and after that there's the interval."
</p>

<p>
"I can tell you everything I know in ten minutes,"
said Tony, "if there are no interruptions."
</p>

<p>
Molly moved quickly to the door and turned the
key in the lock.
</p>

<p>
"Fire ahead," she observed.
</p>

<p>
A week earlier Tony would have found it quite
impossible to crowd the somewhat eventful history
of the last twenty-four hours into the short time at
his disposal.  Practice, however, had been improving
his powers as a story-teller, and without omitting
any really important detail, he actually accomplished
the feat with something like a minute and a half to
spare.
</p>

<p>
Molly was certainly an excellent audience.  Standing
motionless at the door, her lower lip caught tight
between her white teeth, she listened to him with
rapt attention that never wavered or varied.  Even
when he had finished she still remained silent for
a moment; then with a sudden movement she came
towards him, her blue eyes shining with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Tony," she said, speaking with a sort of forced
calmness, "are you absolutely serious about following
them?  Do you really mean to sail for Braxa to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"I do," replied Tony with quite unusual sobriety.
"You see I have just found out that I am really fond
of Isabel, and I don't see any other possible chance
of getting her back."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think this is a possible chance?"  She
put the question with an earnestness that robbed
it of any suggestion of sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's a bit thin," admitted Tony frankly,
"but after all one never knows."  He paused.  "To
a certain extent, Molly," he added, "it depends upon
you."
</p>

<p>
She drew in her breath sharply.  "Me?"
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "You're my trump card," he said
encouragingly.  "You know that signed pass our
friend Peter was obliging enough to give you&mdash;the
one which he said would take you anywhere if he
ever got back to Livadia as king?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Molly slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you're not using it for the moment,"
continued Tony, "I'd be awful obliged if you'd lend
it to me.  If it will really do half of what he said it
would it might come in devilish handy."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's pause, and then a clatter of
footsteps came hurrying down the passage outside,
and someone rapped loudly on the door.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Monk, please," shouted a shrill and
penetrating voice.
</p>

<p>
Molly looked round in the direction of the summons.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Charles," she called out tranquilly:
then turning back she took a momentary glance at
herself in the long mirror that hung against the wall.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be up again in a minute or two, Tony,"
she said, skilfully smoothing out a disordered ribbon.
"Have a cigarette, and don't worry yourself about
the pass.  That will be quite all right."
</p>

<p>
"You'll lend it to me?" exclaimed Tony gratefully.
</p>

<p>
Molly paused on the threshold and looked back
at him with a sort of mischievous elation.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said.  "I won't lend it to you; but
I'll bring it with me."
</p>

<p>
And with this somewhat staggering announcement
she opened the door and disappeared from view.
</p>

<p>
Whatever effect her remark may have had upon
Tony, he appeared to have recovered from it fairly
successfully by the time that she returned.  At all
events she found him reclining in the easy-chair,
enveloped in cigarette smoke, and looking precisely as
comfortable and unruffled as when she had left him.
</p>

<p>
"Was your parting shot serious, Molly?" he asked
in that pleasantly serene voice of his.
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he got up from the chair, and Molly,
who was a little out of breath, dropped into the
vacant seat.
</p>

<p>
"It was," she said; "dead, absolute serious.  If
you want Peter's letter you'll have to take me with
you to Livadia."  She paused and looked up at him.
"Say yes, Tony," she added almost fiercely.  "Don't
you see that I mean it."
</p>

<p>
Tony who was gazing down at her with a sort of
dispassionate admiration, nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"I see you mean it all right, Molly," he said
quietly; "but it's a bit of a bomb-shell you know.
This won't be exactly a healthy trip if we happen to
mess things up."
</p>

<p>
Molly leaned across to the dressing-table and
helped herself to a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Tony dear," she observed.  "I know I'm a
musical comedy actress, but it doesn't necessarily
follow that I'm a complete idiot.  I understand
perfectly that we're taking on about as risky and
hopeless a job as any one could possibly tackle.  If Da
Freitas finds out I should think the odds are about
twenty to one that neither of us will ever come back."  She
struck a match and lighted her cigarette.  "Now
are you satisfied?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you seem to have a fairly sound grip of the
situation," admitted Tony.  "Still that doesn't
make it any the less of a large order."  He paused.
"Good Lord, Molly, why it's madness&mdash;stark staring
madness!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't see it," returned Molly obstinately.  "A
wife's place is by her husband's side&mdash;especially
when he has run away with another woman."
</p>

<p>
In spite of himself Tony laughed.  "But supposing
we reach Livadia&mdash;suppose we actually get into
Portriga&mdash;what can you do even then?"
</p>

<p>
"What's the good of asking me that?" demanded
Molly.  "I don't know any more than you do&mdash;not
till the time comes.  The only thing is&mdash;"  She
broke off, as though not quite sure how to continue.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Tony encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
"It's just an idea&mdash;nothing else at present, but&mdash;but
you have told me several times that this girl and
I are almost exactly alike."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  He was staring at her with a
sudden expression of freshly aroused interest.
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't you see?"  Molly threw away her
cigarette and rose to her feet.  "Surely it's just
possible that somehow&mdash;by some sort of a chance&mdash;we
might be able to make use of this to help us."  She
laughed almost hysterically.  "Oh, I know it
sounds wild and mad, but what notion have you got
that's any better?"
</p>

<p>
Tony took a couple of paces to the door, and back
to where she was standing.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, it's an idea, Molly!" he said slowly.
"If we could get you there without being found
out&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have thought of that," she interrupted.  "I
was thinking of it all the time I was on the
stage."  She paused.  "Tony&mdash;you remember that song I
was singing a couple of years ago&mdash;the one in which
I used to dress up as a curate?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've still got the things I wore&mdash;the clothes
and the wig and the spectacles&mdash;in fact the whole
get-up.  It was so good that once, just for a joke, I went
out into the street in it.  I walked the whole way
down the Strand, and not a soul spotted that there
was anything wrong."
</p>

<p>
The old gleam of mischievous amusement leaped
into Tony's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord, Molly!" he said.  "And you propose
to take the trip&mdash;in those?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" she demanded.  "I can carry it
through all right&mdash;really and truly I can.  After all
there's no reason you couldn't have a curate on board,
is there?"
</p>

<p>
"None at all," said Tony.  "Oh, none at all."  He
leaned against the wall and began to laugh, gently
and joyously.
</p>

<p>
Molly faced him with shining eyes.  "Then you'll
take me?" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Again Tony nodded his head.  "I'll take you,
Molly," he answered, "if it's only for the sake of
seeing Guy's face."
</p>

<p>
There was another clatter and shuffle of footsteps
outside, and the voice of the call-boy came echoing
down the passage.
</p>

<p>
"Beginners, Act two, please!"
</p>

<p>
Tony stopped laughing.  "How about your work?
How about your part here at the theatre?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, damn the theatre," said Molly simply.
"I've got a very good understudy, and they'll have to
put up with her."  She glanced again rapidly at the
clock.  "Listen, Tony&mdash;we've got exactly two minutes,
and then I must start changing.  I shall have to
have the dresser in, and we can't talk in front of her.
Tell me now&mdash;right away&mdash;just what you want me
to do."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Tony reflected rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"I think the best plan will be for you to motor
down with me," he said.  "I can send Guy and
Bugg in one car with Jennings, and call for you at
your place with the other.  I shan't tell Guy
anything about it until you're safe on board."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Molly.  "Do you think he'll mind?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure he will," said Tony cheerfully.  "But
it will be too late for him to do anything then unless
he tries to throw you into the sea."  He paused.
"Can you be ready by nine-thirty sharp?"
</p>

<p>
Molly nodded.  "I won't keep you waiting," she said.
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door, and having been
granted permission to enter, the secretive looking
dresser reappeared on the scene.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon for hinterrupting, Miss," she
observed apologetically, "but it's time you was
startin' to change."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, Jane," said Molly.  She turned to
Tony and held out her hand.  "Well, thanks for
coming and looking me up, Tony," she added.
"See you again quite soon, I hope."
</p>

<p>
Tony raised her hand and kissed the tip of her
fingers.  "Why, yes," he said; "we'll probably run
across each other before long."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was just twenty minutes later when Lady
Jocelyn's pretty parlourmaid opened the door of the
drawing-room at Chester Square, and in a slightly
agitated voice, for such a well trained retainer,
announced the arrival of Sir Antony Conway.
</p>

<p>
Tony, who had followed hard upon her heels, came
straight up to the sofa, where, as usual, his aunt was
sitting.  She looked older and very frail, and her
thin hands trembled a little as she stretched them
to greet him.
</p>

<p>
"Tony!" she exclaimed, "my dear boy!"
</p>

<p>
He sat down beside her, holding her hands in his.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Fanny," he said severely; "you have
been breaking my rules.  You know that you're
never allowed to look unhappy or worried."
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't altogether my fault it happened,
Tony," she said.  "I would have given my stupid
useless old life twice over to have stopped it."
</p>

<p>
In a tender, half jesting fashion he slipped his arm
round her.  "You mustn't talk like that, Aunt
Fanny dear," he said.  "In fact you mustn't talk at
all.  You must just sit still and listen to me.  There
is no time for anything else."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn clasped her hands in her lap.  "Go
on," she said quietly.
</p>

<p>
All the way from the Gaiety to the house, Tony
had been pondering in his mind just how much of the
truth it would be advisable to tell.  Knowing his
aunt, he was not afraid that she would try to dissuade
him from his purpose, however dangerous it might
appear; he was merely anxious to present it in as
favourable a light as possible, so as to spare her any
avoidable anxiety.
</p>

<p>
With this idea he omitted all reference to the
attempt upon the <i>Betty</i>, confining himself entirely to
a description of Congosta's visit.  He repeated the
latter's story of what had happened to Isabel, and
went on to relate how the plan for a possible rescue
had been promptly and happily conceived.  By
means of a little judicious colouring he was able to
make it appear a far more feasible proposition than
when it had originally presented itself in the hall of
Goodman's Rest.
</p>

<p>
Of his subsequent visit to the Gaiety he said
nothing at all.  Molly's presence on board the
<i>Betty</i> in the guise of a curate might or might not be
of assistance, but from the point of view of inspiring
confidence in the enterprise, it seemed to be one of
those features which were better suppressed.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn listened to him without interruption.
Her face betrayed nothing of what she was feeling,
and for a moment after he had finished speaking,
Tony was under the impression that his well meant
efforts had been entirely successful.  Then, with her
faint kindly smile, she laid her hand upon his sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Tony dear," she said.  "It was good
of you to come and tell me all this, and it was nicer
still of you to have told it in the way you have.  Of
course I don't really believe you.  I am quite sure
it's a much more dangerous business than you make
out, but as long as there is the shadow of a chance
of helping Isabel I should be the last to try and
dissuade you.  Go, Tony, and do what you can for her;
and God bless you and help you."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause, and then Tony bent
forward and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you love Isabel," he said simply.
</p>

<p>
"She is the sweetest and bravest girl I have ever
known," answered Lady Jocelyn.  "If you can't
save her from this marriage, Tony, I think it will
break my heart."
</p>

<p>
Tony got up from the sofa, and buttoned his coat.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you worry about that, Aunt Fanny," he
said.  "Peter won't get her&mdash;not if I have to shoot
him at the altar rails."

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
JIMMY DALE
</h3>

<p>
"That," said Captain Simmons, "is Braxa."
</p>

<p>
He pointed out ahead to where the desolate-looking
sandy coast that they had been skirting for some
hours rose suddenly into an irregular line of hills
and cliffs.
</p>

<p>
"If you have a look through these," he added,
"you'll be able to see the entrance to the bay."
</p>

<p>
Tony, who was standing beside him on the bridge,
lightly clad in blue silk pyjamas and a Norfolk jacket,
took the proffered glasses and levelled them in the
direction indicated.  In the bright early morning
sunshine he could plainly make out the small opening
in the coastline, behind which a number of pink and
white houses could be seen straggling picturesquely
up the hillside.
</p>

<p>
"It looks a very nice place," he said generously.
"How long do you think it will take us to get there?"
</p>

<p>
Captain Simmons glanced at his watch.  "We
shall make the point in about three quarters of an
hour," he said.  "We ought to be at anchor by
half-past nine."
</p>

<p>
"In that case," said Tony, "I shall go and have
some breakfast.  I shall be much too excited to
eat eggs and bacon when we're once in the harbour."
</p>

<p>
He left the bridge, and after pausing for a moment
on the warm deck to take another appreciative glance
round at the sunlit expanse of blue sky and
foam-flecked sea, he pursued his leisurely way down the
main companion to his cabin.
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour later he emerged again looking
very cool and comfortable in a well cut suit of
grey flannels.  Nothing would ever induce him to
adopt a more conventional form of yachting costume;
his own explanation being that white duck and blue
serge invariably made him sea-sick.
</p>

<p>
As he passed along the passage on his way to the
saloon, a cabin door swung open and someone stepped
out almost into his arms.  It was Molly, but any one
who could have recognized the fact without being
told so must have possessed an extraordinary
acuteness of perception.
</p>

<p>
As far as outward appearance went she was as
sound and convincing a curate as the most fastidious
vicar could possibly demand.  Even the cleverest
actresses, when they dress up as men, nearly always
betray the fact in a dozen ways, but except for a
certain delicacy of feature, there was absolutely
nothing about her to arouse the faintest suspicion.
With her gold-rimmed spectacles and her smoothly
brushed and amazingly natural wig, she looked a
perfect specimen of that rather fragile type of
young clergyman, who is apt to stir a tender and
half maternal passion in the hearts of middle-aged
spinsters.
</p>

<p>
Tony, who had had forty-eight hours in which to
become accustomed to this masterpiece, stopped and
gazed at her in fresh and profound admiration.
</p>

<p>
"It's marvellous, Molly," he observed, "absolutely
marvellous!  Every time I look at you I feel exactly
as if I was going to say grace."
</p>

<p>
She laughed and in a rather unclerical fashion,
slid her arm through his.
</p>

<p>
"Well, come along and do it then," she said.
"I'm quite ready for breakfast."
</p>

<p>
They made their way to the saloon, where they
found Guy already established, and the steward in
the very act of bringing in the coffee.  Guy's face
was a little pale&mdash;the result of a slight attack of
seasickness on the previous day, and disapproval which
had been stamped firmly on it ever since he had
found out that Molly was to accompany them on
the trip.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know," said Tony, as they seated themselves
at the table, "that in an hour's time we shall
be at anchor in Braxa Harbour?"
</p>

<p>
There was an exclamation from both his companions.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't realize we were as near as that," said
Guy.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you tell me before?" demanded
Molly.  "I should have gone up on deck to have a
look."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had better have your breakfast
first," said Tony.  "It's very bad for one to get
excited on an empty tummy."  He helped himself
handsomely to eggs and bacon.  "Besides we
must be very careful how we show ourselves at
present.  The skipper says there's a coast-guard
station at the entrance to the bay, and if it's still
in working order they have probably got us under
observation already."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think they'll want to come and search
us when we reach the harbour?" asked Guy a little
apprehensively.
</p>

<p>
Tony shrugged his shoulders.  "That's what
they're there for," he said; "but when there's a
revolution and two or three civil wars buzzing about,
people are apt to get a little careless in their work.
Anyhow I'm not worrying myself about that.
Our dear old friend Colonel Saltero is expecting us,
and you can be quite sure he doesn't mean to have
his cartridges mopped up by any one else."  He
paused to refill his cup.  "What I'm thinking about
is Jimmy," he added.  "It will make all the difference
in the world if Jimmy can only manage to get on
board before the Colonel does.  We shall have some
sort of a notion where we are then."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't think there was much chance of it,"
observed Molly.
</p>

<p>
"You never know," said Tony hopefully.  "There's
a lot of resource about Jimmy.  A money-lender
once spent six weeks trying to serve a writ on him,
and he couldn't do it even then."
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the cabin door, and in answer
to Tony's "Come in," one of the crew presented
himself on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, Sir Ant'ny," he began, "the
Captain's compliments, and there's a party o' the
name o' Dale signallin' to us from a small cutter to
starboard.  Says 'e's a friend o' yours, sir.  The
Capt'n wants to know if we shall stop and pick him
up."
</p>

<p>
There was a dramatic pause, and then Tony
wheeled round in his chair so as to face the speaker.
</p>

<p>
"Pick him up!" he repeated.  "Why I should
think so, Jackson.  Pick him' up tenderly&mdash;touch
him with care.  Tell Captain Simmons I'll be up on
deck myself as soon as I've finished this piece of
bacon."
</p>

<p>
With a grin and a salute, the sailor departed, and
turning back to the table, Tony gazed triumphantly
at Guy and Molly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my children," he observed; "what did
uncle tell you?"
</p>

<p>
Molly pushed back her plate.  "It was a put-up
job, Tony," she said, "you knew he was there."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't," retorted Tony, "on my honour.  There
wasn't a boat of any kind in sight when I was on the
bridge.  I feel it's a sign that Providence approves
of us."
</p>

<p>
Molly looked at him and saw that he was speaking
the truth.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we've started," she said with a little
triumphant laugh.  "Can I come up with you?"
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "I think you had better lie
low for the present," he answered.  "You're the
Queen of Trumps in this game, Molly, and we don't
want to play you too soon."
</p>

<p>
Molly looked a trifle disappointed, but she raised
no objection.  "All right," she said obediently.
"I'll save myself up for the King."
</p>

<p>
Tony rose from the table.  "I'll bring Jimmy
down as soon as he's on board," he said.  "You had
better get out the whisky and soda.  He's sure to be
hungry."
</p>

<p>
He left the cabin, followed by Guy, and making his
way up the companion, stepped out on to the smooth
and spotless deck.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Betty</i> had slowed down almost completely and
only a faint ripple in her wake showed that she was
still moving.  Hove to, a little distance ahead, lay
a small cutter of about seven tons, from which a
dinghy with a couple of men on board was just
putting out.
</p>

<p>
They rowed rapidly across the intervening water so
as to cut off the yacht, and timing it to perfection
reached their destination just as she was practically
ceasing to move.  An accommodation ladder had
been let down over the side, and Jimmy, a stout and
happy looking young gentleman who was crouching in
the bows, grabbed hold of it neatly as it came
alongside.  The next moment he had scrambled on board,
and the boat with its solitary occupant was drifting
away astern.
</p>

<p>
"Once aboard the lugger&mdash;" observed the newcomer
in an extraordinarily soft voice, and then
with a faint chuckle he stepped forward and clasped
Tony's outstretched hand.  "Hope I haven't come
too early?" he added cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
Tony wrung his hand, and taking a pace backwards
surveyed him with an affectionate approval.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Jimmy," he said.  "You come like the
flowers in May."
</p>

<p>
"And I may mention," added Jimmy, transferring
his grip to Guy, "that I come after a prolonged and
distressing drought."
</p>

<p>
Tony smiled happily.  "I have ordered breakfast
for you," he said.  "We will go straight down, as
soon as I have introduced you to the skipper."
</p>

<p>
Captain Simmons, who had left the bridge, was
advancing along the deck towards them.
</p>

<p>
"This is my friend Jimmy Dale, Captain," said
Tony.  "He is one of Portriga's most distinguished
citizens."
</p>

<p>
"That so?" said the skipper extending a huge
brown paw.  "Glad to meet you, Mr. Dale.  Perhaps
you can tell us what's going on ashore, and whether
we're likely to hit any trouble if we run straight in
to Braxa."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't think so," replied Jimmy in his soft
and pleasing voice.  "As far as I know all the able-bodied
officials in Braxa have pushed off to Portriga
to join in the looting.  I believe there are one or two
policemen left, but I don't suppose they are awake
yet."
</p>

<p>
"We won't disturb 'em," said the Captain.
"We'll come in nice and quiet, and let 'em have their
nap out.  Do you know the harbour at all, Mr. Dale?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretty fair," said Jimmy.  "I've been out fishing
in it a good number of times."
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps when we get round the Head you
wouldn't mind coming up on the bridge.  I've
never been in here before, and there might be one or
two points I'd be glad of a little information about."
</p>

<p>
"I'll bring him along," said Tony.  "How soon
will he be wanted?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there's no hurry," replied the Captain
genially.  "Plenty o' time for a good breakfast.  We
shan't be off the Head for another twenty minutes
yet."
</p>

<p>
He turned to retrace his steps, and after offering
Jimmy a cigarette, Tony started to lead the way
below.
</p>

<p>
Molly was still sitting at the table when they
entered the saloon, and at the unexpected sight
Jimmy's good-natured countenance betrayed a
momentary surprise and embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I forgot to tell you we had a friend with us,"
said Tony easily.  "Let me introduce you.  The
Reverend Mr. Monk&mdash;my old pal Jimmy Dale."
</p>

<p>
They shook hands gravely&mdash;an action which
proved nearly too much even for the sedate Guy, who
turned away hastily to hide his expression.
</p>

<p>
"Dear old James," said Tony.  "It's so nice to
see you again.  Have some eggs and bacon?"
</p>

<p>
Jimmy sat down at the table and automatically
pulled the whisky and soda towards himself.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have anything that's going," he replied
obligingly.  "But what I should like best of all are a
few explanations.  At present I feel as if I was taking
a small part in a cinematograph film."
</p>

<p>
He squirted a modest supply of soda into his
tumbler, and accepted the well supplied plate which
Molly handed across to him.
</p>

<p>
"You shall have everything in a minute if you are
good and patient," said Tony encouragingly.  "To
start with, however, there are one or two questions
that we want to ask you.  You mayn't be aware of
it, Jimmy, but at the present moment you are a very
valuable and important person."
</p>

<p>
"I felt it," said Jimmy; "I felt it directly I stepped
on board."  He took a deep and apparently much
welcome drink, and set down the tumbler.
</p>

<p>
"We want you to tell us," went on Tony, "exactly
what's been happening in Livadia since the day
before yesterday.  We know all about the beginning
of the Revolution, but we are not quite up-to-date
with the last part."
</p>

<p>
"The day before yesterday," repeated Jimmy
thoughtfully.  "Let's see&mdash;that was Thursday,
wasn't it?  There's been such a lot of blood and noise
and free drinks about that I've got a bit mixed up in
my dates."  He paused to take a large mouthful of
egg and bacon.  "Thursday," he continued a little
indistinctly, "was just about the brightest and
breeziest day we've had.  It was the morning that
Almaida made his big attack on the Royalists, and
they were scrapping from eight o'clock until three or
four in the afternoon.  They would have gone on
longer, only all the wine shops had been cleaned out
by then and everybody was so thirsty that they had
to stop."
</p>

<p>
"And what happened?" asked Guy.  "Who got
the best of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose it was more or less of a drawn
battle," returned Jimmy indifferently.  "Almaida
managed to cross the river and bag the railway
station and the Town Hall, but as they'd both been
burned to the ground I don't suppose he got much
for his trouble.  It was quite a merry little romp
while it lasted though."
</p>

<p>
Tony reached across for the whisky and helped
himself to a companion peg.
</p>

<p>
"What did you do in the great war, Daddy?" he
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Me!" said Jimmy.  "Oh, I was a very good little
boy.  I hoisted the Union Jack, and stopped in my
own house, and when any one tried the front door
I fired at them out of the window.  I don't think
I hit anybody&mdash;I'm such a putrid shot with a
revolver."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you did your best," said Tony consolingly,
"and that's all that really matters."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy shook his head.  "I used up a lot of
cartridges," he objected, "and they cost no end of
money out here.  Besides I should like to have
slaughtered just one Livadian.  One doesn't often
get the chance of doing such a good turn to humanity."
</p>

<p>
"But how about the Revolution?" broke in Guy a
trifle impatiently.  "What happened after the
fighting came to an end?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the fighting didn't come to an end," returned
Jimmy.  "It was only the battle.  People went on
shooting each other privately all night, and next
morning there was some sort of an attempt at another
general engagement.  It was nothing like Thursday,
however, because both sides were running short of
ammunition.  However, I thought it seemed healthier
indoors, so I stayed where I was until about three
o'clock, when I suddenly noticed that the shooting
was beginning to stop, and that the people were
gathering together into groups and jawing and jabbering
like a lot of monkeys.  I guessed that something
had happened, so I loaded up my revolver and shoved
on a hat, and tootled out into the sunshine."
</p>

<p>
He paused to select a cigar from the case which
Tony was holding out to him.
</p>

<p>
"Almost the first person I ran into," he went on,
"was a man I happened to know.  I asked him what
was up, and he told me that there was a report all
over the town that Pedro and Da Freitas had just
arrived from England with Don Francisco's daughter,
and that she and the King were going to be married
at once.  Well, of course, that put the hat on
everything so to speak.  Whatever Almaida's private
notions may have been, he was nominally fighting
to make this girl Queen of Livadia, and if she was
really going to be married to Pedro, the whole thing
was nothing but a damned farce."  He coughed
and turned to Molly.  "Sorry, Padre," he added
apologetically.  "Forgot you were here."
</p>

<p>
Molly inclined her head gravely, and once again
Guy turned away to conceal his emotions.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, James," said Tony in a reassuring voice.
"You needn't be afraid of shocking Mr. Monk.  He
has been chaplain to a bishop."
</p>

<p>
"There's not so very much more to tell," said
Jimmy.  "At first, of course, most of Almaida's
people thought it was just a bluff on the part of the
Royalists&mdash;a sort of trick to try and upset 'em and
then catch 'em on the hop.  By six o'clock, however,
posters and bills began to be shoved up all over the
place.  No one seemed to know who was doing it,
but there they were as large as life, saying that the
marriage would come off in the Cathedral on Sunday
morning, and calling upon all the Franciscans to lay
down their arms.  I was coming back home, when I
found one of them stuck up on the post-office wall,
almost exactly opposite my house.  I stopped to
have a look, and while I was reading it a chap came
sidling down the street and pulled up alongside of me.
He was a pretty average looking sort of scoundrel,
with a dirty bandage round his head instead of a
cap.  I could see that he was squinting at me out
of the corner of his eye, and I was just wondering
whether I'd better move on quietly or plug him hard
on the jaw, when he suddenly asked me in a hoarse
whisper if I was the Señor James Dale.  I told him I
was, and then to my utter astonishment he gabbled
out some message to the effect that you were coming
to Livadia and that the <i>Betty</i> was expected at Braxa
early this morning.  It fairly took my breath away
for a minute, and before I could ask him a single
question some more people came round the corner of
the street, and he skidded off like a rat when it sees a
terrier."
</p>

<p>
Tony laughed softly.  "Have another drink,
James," he suggested.  "I'm sorry to have given you
these nervous shocks, but we were rather pressed for
time."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I rallied all right," said Jimmy, helping
himself to a second peg.  "It was a bit of a thunderbolt
for a moment, but knowing your taste in amusements
I realized at once that it was just the sort of
time you would choose for a pleasure trip to Livadia.
Of course I hadn't a notion how you had managed to
get the message through to me, but after all that
didn't really matter.  The great thing was to get to
Braxa in time to meet you."
</p>

<p>
He paused to refresh himself.
</p>

<p>
"How did you manage it?" inquired Guy.  "I
suppose there are no trains running or anything of
that sort."
</p>

<p>
"The only thing that's running in Livadia at
the present moment is blood," returned Jimmy
cheerfully.  "Fortunately for me, however, I'd got a
car.  I sneaked it out of the garage quietly on
Monday when the trouble started, and I had it locked up
in a sort of out-house at the back of my place.  I
knew, of course, that I hadn't a dog's chance of getting
out of the town with it on my own, so without fooling
around I went straight off to the British Consulate,
which is quite close to where I live.  I managed to
get hold of Watson himself, and he gave me a letter
saying that I was a British subject, and if anybody
interfered with me all sorts of giddy things would
happen to him.  Of course it wasn't exactly a
gilt-edged security in a time like this: still it was
the best thing I could get, and I thought that
with the help of a bit of bluff it might pull me
through."  He paused.  "Well, to cut a long yarn
short, it did.  I had a little trouble on the road, but
I reached Braxa at last&mdash;about three o'clock this
morning&mdash;and knocked up an old boy that I used to
go fishing with.  I explained the situation to
him&mdash;more or less&mdash;and we came to the conclusion that the
best plan would be to pick you up outside the harbour.
He helped me stuff away the car in an old shed
he's got up at the top of the jetty; then we just
tumbled into his boat and&mdash;and&mdash;well, here we are."  He
leaned back and surveyed his companions.  "And
now," he added placidly, "perhaps you'll be kind
enough to let me know what the devil it all means."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief pause.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell him if you like," offered Guy.
</p>

<p>
Tony glanced at his watch.  "I think you had
better leave it to me," he said.  "We shall be wanted
on deck in a few minutes, and I've had such a lot of
practice, I'm sure I can tell it quicker than any one
else."  He turned to Jimmy.  "It's an exciting
story, James; but you must listen very carefully and
not interrupt me."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dale crossed his legs.  "Let her rip," he
observed tranquilly.
</p>

<p>
Once more, and this time with a masterly brevity
that put all his previous efforts in the shade, Tony
proceeded to relate the series of stimulating incidents
which had sprung from his chance encounter with
Isabel outside the Long Acre flats.  Owing to his
highly condensed method it was impossible to avoid
a certain obscurity about some of the details, but
obedient to his instructions Jimmy received it all in
unquestioning silence.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, even after Tony had finished, he
still remained mute; then with a sudden soft little
chuckle he got up from his chair, and thrust his hands
deep into his trouser pockets.
</p>

<p>
"My sainted Aunt!" he observed.  "If ever
there was a purple picnic on this earth it seems to me
we've struck it."  He paused, as though
overwhelmed with the magnificence of the situation.
"And this girl," he went on slowly, "this girl who's
so like the Princess?  Do you really mean to say
that you have brought her with you&mdash;that you've
got her here&mdash;on board?"
</p>

<p>
"We have," replied Tony, "very much so."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy glanced round the cabin.  "Well, where is
she?  What have you done with her?"
</p>

<p>
Tony turned his seat in the direction of the
Rev. Mr. Monk.
</p>

<p>
"Get up, Molly," he said.  "Get up and make
the gentleman a nice curtsey."
</p>

<p>
With her most bewitching smile, Molly rose to her
feet, and picking up the skirts of her coat in either
hand, sank gracefully towards the floor.
</p>

<p>
For an instant, for just one poignant instant,
Jimmy remained gazing at her in open-mouthed
incredulity; and then with an apologetic rap on the
door the seaman Jackson again presented himself
on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, Sir Ant'ny&mdash;the Capt'n's compliments,
and he'd be glad to see you and the other
gentleman on the bridge."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
COUNTERPLOTTING
</h3>

<p>
It would have been difficult to find anything more
restful looking than Braxa Harbour, as it lay flooded
in the morning sunshine.  Whatever bloodthirsty
events might have taken place further inland, they
had certainly failed to produce any visible effect
upon this tranquil little fishing village.
</p>

<p>
From the bridge of the <i>Betty</i>, which had come to
anchor a couple of hundred yards off the end of the
long stone jetty, there was nothing to be seen that
in any way broke the agreeable atmosphere of peace
and harmony.  Except for a few old boats, the sandy
beach was absolutely deserted, while the pink and
white houses, that clambered up the hill at the back,
seemed pleasantly asleep in the shadow of their
surrounding trees.  Round a low headland on the
right, a small river meandered out into the bay, its
tranquil current being plainly visible against the
clear blue of the sea water.
</p>

<p>
"I've seen livelier looking places," observed
Captain Simmons critically, "but I can't say I ever
saw a much more dangerous harbour for a big yacht,
not if it should come on to blow from the sou'-west."
</p>

<p>
Tony leaned meditatively over the rail and
inspected the prospect.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid we have arrived a little early," he said.
"The Mayor and Corporation don't seem to be up yet."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there's never much of a rush here in the
morning," remarked Jimmy, who was standing
beside him.  "I once saw a dog on the beach before
breakfast, but I think he'd been out all night."  He
tossed the stump of his cigar over the side and
watched it drop down into the water.  "What do we
do now?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Well, considering that we've come by invitation,"
answered Tony, "I should say the best thing was to
sit tight and admire the view.  Somebody will
probably notice that we've arrived, sooner or later."
</p>

<p>
With a sudden movement the Captain raised his
glasses, and levelled them on the point away to the
right where the river ran out into the bay.
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me," he observed, "that somebody's
noticed it already."
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the headland, and as he did so both
his companions suddenly caught sight of something
low and black in the water that was moving slowly out
of the mouth of the river.
</p>

<p>
"It's a petrol launch," said the skipper, "and
unless I'm much mistaken they're coming along to
say good-morning to us."
</p>

<p>
With quiet deliberation Tony surveyed the advancing
vessel, which was already swinging round in
the direction of the <i>Betty</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I can't see any one yet," he announced, "but
it's pretty sure to be Colonel Saltero.  Jimmy, you'd
better go downstairs and lock yourself in the
bathroom with Molly.  I don't want him to know that
we're a passenger steamer.'
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," said Jimmy with alacrity.
"Come and tell us when it's all over."
</p>

<p>
He climbed down the bridge ladder, whistling
tunefully to himself, and turning back towards the
approaching launch, Tony again scrutinized it
carefully through his glasses.
</p>

<p>
As it drew nearer he was able to see that there were
three men on board, and amongst them he soon made
out the square-shouldered, aggressive figure of
Colonel Saltero.  That distinguished warrior was
seated in the stern, and even from a considerable
distance one could detect the air of truculent
authority with which he was directing operations.
</p>

<p>
Tony snapped his glasses together and turned to
the skipper.
</p>

<p>
"I think I had better go down on the deck, and
prepare to make pretty speeches," he said.  "I
suppose they will be able to come alongside all right."
</p>

<p>
Captain Simmons eyed his advancing visitors with
an air of mistrustful calculation.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't go as far as that," he observed
grimly, "but I dare say they'll manage it somehow
or other."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Tony, "paint's cheap."
</p>

<p>
He descended in leisurely fashion to the deck, and
walked across to the starboard side, where the
members of the crew had collected together awaiting the
skipper's orders.
</p>

<p>
A little apart from the others, and leaning over the
rail, stood Mr. McEwen and "Tiger" Bugg.  For some
obscure reason these two had struck up an immediate
and firm friendship, with the result that Bugg had
spent practically the entire trip in the breezy
atmosphere of the engine-room.
</p>

<p>
Tony strolled up and joined them.
</p>

<p>
"Guid-morning to ye, Sir Antony," observed the
chief engineer removing his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Mr. McEwen," said Tony.  "Having
a look at the visitors?"
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.
</p>

<p>
"I was wondering," said Mr. McEwen softly,
"whether yon swab who put that nine-inch spanner
in my cylinder micht be amang the pairty."
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "I'm afraid not," he replied
regretfully.
</p>

<p>
There was a sudden exclamation of interest from
Bugg.
</p>

<p>
"Why, look, sir!  See 'im, sir?  It's the cross-eyed
bloke.  The one I knocked aht in Long Acre."
</p>

<p>
He pointed excitedly towards the approaching
launch, above which the sombre scowl of Colonel
Saltero was now plainly visible to the naked eye.
</p>

<p>
"You're quite right, Bugg," said Tony.  "It's
the same gentleman, but he is coming to see me this
time in a nice friendly spirit, so perhaps you had
better keep out of the way.  He mightn't like to be
reminded of that push in the face."
</p>

<p>
With his usual ready obedience Bugg faded from
the scene, and as he did so the voice of Captain
Simmons came curtly and incisively from the bridge.
</p>

<p>
"Stand by with the fender, and look out for our
paint."
</p>

<p>
A couple of the crew, under the direction of the
second officer, hurried to fulfil the order, while two
others climbed over the rail, ready to drop down and
assist in the operation.
</p>

<p>
Shutting off her engine as she approached, the
launch came swirling round in a half circle.  There
was a brief moment of strained suspense, and then
skilfully avoiding the fender, she bumped heavily
alongside, in a fashion that brought a cry of anguish
from Captain Simmons' lips.  The two waiting sailors
dropped nimbly on to her deck, and commenced to
make her fast, and the next moment, flushed but
triumphant, Colonel Saltero was mounting the
accommodation ladder.
</p>

<p>
As he emerged over the top, Tony stepped forward
to meet him.
</p>

<p>
"How d'you do, Colonel?" he observed in a
friendly voice.  "Glad to see you again."
</p>

<p>
Clicking his heels together, Colonel Saltero made
him a stiff military bow.
</p>

<p>
"Permit me, Sir Antony," he replied, "to welcome
you to Livadia."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much," said Tony.  Then pausing
for a moment to allow his visitor to recover a
perpendicular position, he added hospitably: "Come
along down and have a whisky."
</p>

<p>
The invitation did not seem to be altogether
unwelcome, but like a true soldier the Colonel's first
considerations were evidently for his duty.
</p>

<p>
"You have brought the cartridges?" he demanded,
with a swift and slightly suspicious glance round the
deck.
</p>

<p>
"Rather," said Tony, "any amount of 'em."  He
turned to the second officer.  "You had better start
getting those boxes on board the launch right away,"
he added.  "Colonel Saltero and I are going below to
have a little chat."
</p>

<p>
He led the way down the companion to his private
cabin, and ushering his guest in closed the door behind
them.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you got Congosta's message all right
then," he said, going to the cupboard and getting out
the whisky and soda.  "You know what an unholy
mess I've managed to make of things."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel, who was standing in a stiff and
military attitude, made a slight gesture of assent.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Antony!" he said, "I am a soldier, and it is
my habit to speak plain words.  I will not hide my
opinion that with regard to the Princess you have
failed us badly."
</p>

<p>
Tony splashed out a full-handed allowance of old
Glenlivet and sprinkled it carefully with soda.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," he said encouragingly.  "Say exactly
what you like."
</p>

<p>
He handed the glass to the Colonel, who took a
long and apparently satisfactory drink.
</p>

<p>
"At the same time," continued the latter, "I
do not wish to be ungrateful.  If what Señor
Congosta tells me is true, you have done your best to
make up for your fault.  These cartridges&mdash;" he set
down the empty tumbler&mdash;"these cartridges, which I
understand you have presented to the army, may yet
be the means of saving Livadia."
</p>

<p>
"That's good," observed Tony.  "But how are
you going to get them to Portriga?"
</p>

<p>
The Colonel made a gesture with his hand.  "There
is no difficulty.  The river which you see runs up
within two miles of the town, and both banks are
strongly held by our men."
</p>

<p>
"What about the people here&mdash;the coast-guards
and police?  Are they on your side?"
</p>

<p>
Colonel Saltero smiled sombrely.  "There are no
coast-guards left," he said.  "As for the police&mdash;" he
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"some say that the officer
in command here is a friend of Da Freitas, but I do
not think he will interfere with us."
</p>

<p>
Tony stretched out his hand, and picking up his
guest's empty glass commenced to refill it.
</p>

<p>
"That sounds all right as far as it goes," he
remarked; "but it seems to me we are up against
another pretty stiff problem.  If Pedro marries the
Princess, as I suppose he will, it rather knocks the
bottom out of your game&mdash;doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment the Colonel hesitated.  Despite the
gift of the cartridges, some faint suspicion of Tony's
entire good faith seemed still to linger in his mind.
</p>

<p>
"We are not without our plans," he replied cautiously.
</p>

<p>
Without appearing to notice the implied mistrust
Tony filled the tumbler and handed it back to
him.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," he remarked cheerfully.  "You
and Señor Congosta are not the sort of people to
leave things to chance.  I was only wondering if I
couldn't be of any further help to you.  It was all
my fault the Princess was captured, and I want to
do everything I can to make up for it."
</p>

<p>
This frank and simple speech, or else a second
long draught of Glenlivet which the Colonel promptly
poured down his throat, seemed to have a slightly
mellowing effect upon that reserved warrior.
</p>

<p>
"We have a plan," he repeated, "but I will admit
to you, Sir Antony, that there is much danger.  Even
now it is known everywhere that the Princess is in
Da Freitas' hands, and already there are those who
say 'what is the use of more fighting?'  If we
had money&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Money!" exclaimed Tony.  "My dear chap,
why didn't you say so before?"  He crossed again
to the cupboard, and stooping down took out two fat
white bags, which he placed upon the table with an
agreeable chink.
</p>

<p>
"I thought it just possible you might be short of
cash," he explained, "so I brought a couple of
thousand along with me."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel's eyes glistened.
</p>

<p>
"In gold?" he asked hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
Tony loosened the mouth of one of the bags, and
tipped out a little shining stream of yellow coins.
</p>

<p>
"All in the best English sovereigns," he said,
gathering them up and replacing them again.  Then,
with a graceful gesture, he pushed both bags across
the table.  "Take them, Colonel," he added.
"Take them from me as a small gift towards the
freedom of Livadia."
</p>

<p>
For a moment the Colonel was too overcome to
speak.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Antony," he exclaimed at last, "you must
give me your pardon.  Congosta was right in what
he said.  I did you a great wrong in ever doubting
your honour."  He raised his half empty glass.
"I drink," he said, "to the saviour of my
country."
</p>

<p>
Tony bowed.  "That," he replied, "is a title
which I think already belongs to you&mdash;or Señor
Congosta."
</p>

<p>
There was a dramatic pause, and then the Colonel
set down his glass.
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you," he said bluntly, "what it is that
we propose to do.  It is right that you should know."  With
an instinctive glance round the cabin, as if to
make quite certain that there were no eavesdroppers,
he advanced towards the table.  "In the afternoon,
yesterday," he went on, "Pedro and Da Freitas landed
in Portriga.  They have brought the Princess and
the Count de Sé with them.  Already there are
notices, placed up all over the town, saying that on
Sunday morning the marriage will take place in the
Cathedral."
</p>

<p>
Tony looked at him with an expression of amazement.
"I say!" he exclaimed.  "They haven't
wasted much time."
</p>

<p>
"It is not in the way of Da Freitas to waste time,"
agreed the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Tony remained silent.  "Well, what
are you going to do?" he asked.  "It seems to me that
unless you can stop this interesting little arrangement
the whole thing's finished.  You can't expect
people to go on fighting for a queen who's already
on the throne."
</p>

<p>
Saltero came a step closer still.  "There will be no
wedding," he said grimly.  "By ten o'clock to-night
the Princess will be in our hands."
</p>

<p>
He paused, as if to allow the statement time to
sink in.
</p>

<p>
Tony indulged in a low whistle.  "By Jove!" he
exclaimed.  "How are you going to work it?"
</p>

<p>
Once more the Colonel glanced round the cabin,
and then sunk his voice to a kind of low rumble,
which was apparently as near as he could get to a
whisper.
</p>

<p>
"We have found out that the Princess has been
taken to the Château of Saint Anna.  It is in the
mountains, ten miles from Portriga.  The Count de
Saint Anna is an old friend of Pedro's father."
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to attack the place?"  Tony put
the question quite quietly, though his fingers had
tightened a little upon the cigarette that he was
holding.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel shook his head.  "It is impossible.
There is only one road up through the hills, and all
the approaches to it are held by Da Freitas' soldiers.
A hundred men could defend it against an army.'
</p>

<p>
"It sounds a bit awkward," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Saltero smiled malevolently.  "It is our
good fortune," he continued, "to have had further
information.  We have learned that at nine o'clock
to-night the Princess will be brought into the town
in order that she may be ready for the ceremony in
the morning.  Doubtless there will be an escort&mdash;a
strong escort, but all the same&mdash;" he paused and
his grey eyes narrowed into a couple of dangerous
looking slits&mdash;"I do not think that they will ever
reach Portriga.  I do not think that they will get
further than the bridge at Valona."
</p>

<p>
Tony laid down his cigarette.  "I hope you will be
careful if there's going to be a scrap," he said
anxiously.  "I shouldn't like anything to happen to
Isabel.  She seemed rather a nice girl."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel drew himself up a little stiffly.  "Our
plans have been well made," he replied.  "There
will be no danger to the Princess.  By ten o'clock
she will be safe with General Almaida."
</p>

<p>
There was another and longer pause.
</p>

<p>
"If it comes off," observed Tony slowly, "it will
be a nasty jar for Pedro and Da Freitas."
</p>

<p>
Once again the Colonel smiled viciously.  "It will
be the end," he said.  "Da Freitas has staked
everything upon this marriage, and if he cannot
bring forward the Princess on Sunday, the whole
country will know that they have been deceived.
There will be risings and riots everywhere: even his
own soldiers will turn against him.  Then we shall
attack again, and this time there will be no going
back.  Before night comes, Isabella will be Queen
of Livadia."
</p>

<p>
He stooped forward, and gathering up the two
bags of gold stepped back from the table.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's very good of you to have told me all
this," said Tony gratefully.  "It has made me feel
much more comfortable in my mind."  He laid his
hand upon the whisky bottle.  "Have another drink
before we go up?" he suggested.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel shook his head with some regret.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, no," he said.  "There are many
things to do, and the time is short.  With your
permission we will return to the deck."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br /><br />
THE SOLUTION
</h3>

<p>
"And that," said Tony, leaning back in his chair,
"is absolutely every damned thing that I could get
out of him."
</p>

<p>
His three companions, Molly, Guy, and Jimmy,
who were seated in various attitudes round the cabin
table, surveyed him for a moment in deep and
reflective silence.
</p>

<p>
Then Guy cleared his throat.  "On the whole,"
he said, "I think you have managed remarkably
well."
</p>

<p>
"I did my best," replied Tony modestly, "but he's
a reticent blighter for a Colonel.  I didn't dare pump
him any further for fear that he might get suspicious.
As it is I think he was half sorry he had told me as
much as he had before I got him over the side."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we've collected quite a lot of interesting
stuff to go on with," said Jimmy contentedly.  "The
great question is how are we going to use it?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you know where these two places are?"
asked Tony.  "The Château of Saint Anna&mdash;and the
bridge at Valona?"
</p>

<p>
Jimmy nodded.  "Both of 'em.  There isn't a
yard of this country I haven't tootled over at some
time or other."  He looked hopefully at Tony.
"Have you got any bright notion at the back of your
mind?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," said Tony.  "I haven't had the chance
of working things out.  That's what I've called this
Cabinet Council for."  He turned to his cousin.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think about it, Guy?" he asked.
"You're the eldest, so you shall speak first."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me," said Guy deliberately, "that
there is not the faintest chance of rescuing Isabel,
except by the employment of violence."
</p>

<p>
There was a soft and delighted chuckle from
Jimmy to which he paid no attention.
</p>

<p>
"That being so," he continued calmly, "the
question resolves itself into where and how we should
make the attempt.  As far as I can see there is only
one answer.  If we can reach Valona, it's just possible
that in the confusion of this attack one or other of
us might manage to get away with Isabel.  Of course
it's much more likely that we shall all be killed, but if
one chooses to mix oneself up in this sort of insane
business that is an objection which one must be
prepared to face."
</p>

<p>
He closed his lips tight in their customary precise
line, and looked round at the assembled company.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Guy," said Tony.  "That's just the
sort of spirited speech I should have expected from
one of your aggressive character."  He paused.
"Now, Jimmy, what have you got to say?"
</p>

<p>
Jimmy rose solemnly to his feet.  "I have much
pleasure," he observed, "in seconding the proposal
of our honourable friend.  I'm for a forward policy
every time."  He looked across the table.  "How
about the Reverend Mr. Monk?" he added.  "It
seems to me we ought to have asked his opinion
first."
</p>

<p>
"I think," said Molly sweetly and clearly, "that
it's just about the silliest suggestion I ever heard."
</p>

<p>
Guy sat up suddenly in his chair, and Jimmy, who
was still standing on his feet, broke into another long
chuckle of laughter.
</p>

<p>
Tony rapped the table gravely with a teaspoon.
</p>

<p>
"Order, please," he said, "order!  This is no time
for misplaced merriment."  He turned to Molly.
"Don't worry about Guy's feelings," he added
kindly.  "Say exactly what you think."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to," replied Molly with brisk determination.
"I'm awfully sorry if I was rude to you,
Mr. Oliver; but really you know your plan's a rotter.
Do you suppose that even if we got to Valona, these
people would allow us to hang about there waiting
for something to happen?  Why, they would guess
what we were up to the very moment they spotted us."
</p>

<p>
"But we know the time, roughly," protested
Jimmy.  "We could arrange to reach the place just
when the fighting started."
</p>

<p>
"And what then?" demanded Molly scornfully.
"Here you've got a large party of armed men, who
are cheerfully ready to murder a whole escort in order
to get hold of this girl.  Do you really imagine they
are going to let us waltz in and pick her up under
their noses?  Not likely!"
</p>

<p>
She stopped to take breath.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I had made it clear," remarked Guy a
little chillingly, "that I didn't regard the suggestion
as a very safe or hopeful one."
</p>

<p>
"You did," said Molly, "but you didn't go half
far enough.  It's a dead certain frost from the very
start.  We should just be committing suicide
without doing any good to anybody."
</p>

<p>
Guy shrugged his shoulders.  "I daresay you're
right.  The unfortunate point is that there's no
alternative."
</p>

<p>
Molly leaned forward, her blue eyes shining with
excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is," she said quietly.
</p>

<p>
For an instant nobody spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, Molly," said Tony.  "We are all listening
to you."
</p>

<p>
"If we can get to Valona," said Molly, speaking
in a rapid and eager voice, "what is there to stop
us getting to the other place&mdash;the Château of Saint
Anna?"
</p>

<p>
There was another and longer pause.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" remarked Jimmy, and with this
non-committal observation he reseated himself at
the table.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" continued Molly defiantly.  "We can't
do anything without running a big risk, so while
we're about it we may just as well shove all our
money on the best chance."
</p>

<p>
"But surely," protested Guy, "if there is an
utterly hopeless&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let Molly explain," said Tony.  "We can
criticize her afterwards."
</p>

<p>
Once again there was a brief silence.
</p>

<p>
"It's like this," said Molly.  "At the present
moment, so far as we know, there isn't a soul on
Peter's side who has the remotest notion that we're in
Livadia.  That's our strongest card, and if we don't
play it for all it's worth we shall be simply chucking
the game away."  She wheeled round on Jimmy.
"Where is this Château, exactly?" she asked.
"Can you get to it from here in your car without
going through Portriga or the other place&mdash;Valona?"
</p>

<p>
Jimmy nodded.  "We should turn off the main
road up into the hills about five miles from here.
The car would manage it all right, but as for
getting there&mdash;" he grinned cheerfully&mdash;"well,
from what the Colonel told Tony, I should think
we had about as much chance as a snowflake in
hell."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't worry about that part of it,"
returned Molly coolly.  "So long as you know the
road you can leave the rest to me."  She put her
hand into her breast pocket, and produced the thick
and impressive looking half sheet of note-paper,
which she had shown Tony in the flat.  "If that
won't get us past a few soldiers," she added, throwing
it on the table, "we may as well turn the boat round
now and go straight home."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" exclaimed Tony.  "I believe you've
got hold of the right idea, Molly!"
</p>

<p>
Guy looked from one to the other of them in a
sort of baffled bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"I may be very stupid," he said, "but I can't
see in the least what you hope to do even if we reach
the Château."
</p>

<p>
Molly drew in a long breath.  "There's only one
thing to do," she said slowly.  "Somehow or other
this Princess girl and I have got to change places.
There's absolutely no other way in which we can
possibly work it."
</p>

<p>
If she had suddenly placed a live bomb upon the
table, Guy's face could hardly have assumed a more
startled expression.  Even Jimmy, who did not seem
to be easily perturbed, remained staring at her for a
moment with his mouth open.
</p>

<p>
"Change places!" repeated Guy at last.  "Are
you speaking seriously?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am," said Molly a little impatiently.
"Don't you see how easily it could be done?  According
to what you all tell me, this girl and I are as like
each other as two peas: but no one would guess that
if they'd only seen me in this rig-out.  Well, if I
could get a quarter of an hour alone with her, all we
should have to do would be to swap clothes, and then
she could just walk out of the place instead of me."  She
swept a triumphant glance at the others.  "It's
a hundred to one nobody would notice the difference:
not if she's got the pluck and sense to carry it off
properly."
</p>

<p>
"I can guarantee the pluck and the sense," said
Tony.  "They are two things in which Isabel
happens to specialize rather deeply."
</p>

<p>
"But do you mean you are ready to stop behind in
her place?"
</p>

<p>
It was Jimmy who put the question.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I am," replied Molly.  "That's what
I have come out here for."
</p>

<p>
He gazed at her for a moment in voiceless admiration.
</p>

<p>
"My Lord, you've got some nerve," he said.
"What do you think will happen to you?"
</p>

<p>
Molly smiled pleasantly.  "I think," she
answered, "that I shall be respectably and properly
married to Peter in the Portriga Cathedral.  I don't
see what the devil else they can afford to do.  They
have got to have a wedding, and as I'm quite ready to
pretend that I'm the Princess, and nobody's ever
likely to contradict it, it seems to me they'll jolly well
have to make the best of it."
</p>

<p>
Tony laid down his cigarette and leaned back in
his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Molly," he said, "you are as brilliant as you are
beautiful.  I don't believe there is any one else alive
who could have thought of a notion like that when
they were full of eggs and bacon."
</p>

<p>
"It's a terrific idea," admitted Jimmy, still gazing
respectfully at the author.  "The one great difficulty
will be to fix up this interview between you and the
Princess."
</p>

<p>
Molly nodded.  "I know," she said.  "I haven't
got that part of it clear yet.  You see the whole
thing only came into my head quite suddenly."
</p>

<p>
"That part of it," remarked Tony in his tranquil
voice, "seems to me delightfully simple and
easy."
</p>

<p>
They all three turned towards him.
</p>

<p>
"We are personal friends of Peter's," he went on;
"at least I am.  I think I shall call myself Lord
Haverstock.  It's a very nice title and no one's
taken it yet.  Do you think it suits me, Guy?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go on," exclaimed Guy impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"At Peter's suggestion," continued Tony, "I have
accompanied him from England in my own yacht,
in order to be in at the death, so to speak.  Molly
here is my chaplain.  All really respectable English
peers travel with a private chaplain."
</p>

<p>
He paused as if for confirmation.
</p>

<p>
"I've no doubt you're right," said Jimmy gravely,
"but how does that interesting fact help us?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, don't you see?  Isabel has been brought up
with English ideas about these sort of things, and it's
surely only natural that she should feel a little upset
at the thought of being married so suddenly, and
without any of her old friends to help her.  She has
told Peter that if it was possible she would like to
have a talk with an English clergyman, and knowing
that I have got the Reverend Mr. Monk on board,
Peter has suggested that I should take him along to
the Château.  Of course, for various reasons, he didn't
want a fuss made about it, so he has just given me his
own private pass, and told me to explain the rest
to the Count of Saint Anna.  What could be more
beautifully simple and probable?"
</p>

<p>
Molly clapped her hands softly.  "Splendid,
Tony!" she said.  "Absolutely splendid!"
</p>

<p>
"And suppose," remarked Guy in his depressingly
matter-of-fact voice, "that the first person we run
into at the Château is Isabel's uncle or the Marquis
da Freitas or the King himself.  What's going to
happen then?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know exactly," said Tony, "but I should
say that in all probability there will be the hell of a
row."
</p>

<p>
"It's no good worrying about that," said Molly
decisively.  "We've got to chance something, and
the odds are that all three of them will be down in
Portriga.  I imagine that that's why they've sent
the girl to this place&mdash;in order to have their hands
free."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded his agreement.  "There's a lot of
hard work about running a revolution," he observed.
"I shouldn't think they would be able to spare
anybody this morning."
</p>

<p>
Molly looked round at the other two.  "Well,"
she said, "Tony and I have made up our minds at
all events.  Are you ready to back us up?"
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.
</p>

<p>
"I will do anything I can," remarked Guy
simply.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy leaned back and thrust his hands into his
trouser pocket's.
</p>

<p>
"So will I, of course," he said.  "The only thing I
don't like about it is leaving you behind.  Suppose
they turn nasty when they find out?"
</p>

<p>
Molly smiled at him comfortingly.  "That's all
right," she said.  "Peter has got his weak points,
but if any one was to hurt the tip of my little finger he
would have the last drop of blood they've got.  Da
Freitas knows that as well as I do."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to hear he appreciates you," said Jimmy
with feeling.  "You are much too good for him."  He
hesitated.  "Look here," he added suddenly,
"suppose he's killed, suppose somebody shoots him&mdash;it's
quite possible you know&mdash;will you come back to
England and marry me?"
</p>

<p>
Molly broke into a little ripple of silvery laughter.
</p>

<p>
"I daresay I might," she said.  "Anyhow, it's nice
to have something to fall back on in case one wants it."
</p>

<p>
"I hate to interrupt a really passionate love
affair," observed Tony apologetically, "but don't
you think we ought to discuss our arrangements&mdash;such
as they are?  We haven't too much time to spare."
</p>

<p>
"Well, they're pretty straight sailing, aren't
they?" replied Jimmy.  "There's plenty of petrol
in the car, so all we've got to do is to go ashore and
start off."
</p>

<p>
"Who's we?" demanded Molly.  "You and I and Tony?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't I come too?" inquired Guy in a rather
disappointed voice.  "I'm quite ready to do my
share&mdash;whatever it is?"
</p>

<p>
Tony got up from where he was sitting and laid a
sympathetic hand on his cousin's shoulder..
</p>

<p>
"I know that, Guy," he aid.  "I know that you
would cut the throats of half Livadia if it would help
Isabel in any way.  The point is that we can't afford
to do any fighting this trip.  We have got to bring it
off peacefully, if we bring it off at all, and it's quite
possible that the real danger will be at this end, and
not at the Château.  I told you what Saltero said
about the police here.  Well, don't you see, if they
chose to interfere they might put the hat on
everything.  I want you to take charge while we're away,
and whatever happens&mdash;even if you have to murder
every policeman in the town&mdash;there must be a nice
comfy boat awaiting us when we get back."
</p>

<p>
Guy nodded grimly.  "Very well," he said; "you
can count on that, if there're any of us left alive!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br /><br />
GETTING ACCESS TO ISABEL
</h3>

<p>
It was almost exactly half an hour later, when the
<i>Betty's</i> gig, skilfully piloted by the second officer,
drew up alongside the jetty.  Tony, Jimmy, and
Molly scrambled out in turn&mdash;the latter carrying a
small prayer-book in her hand and lending a pleasant
air of respectability to the party.
</p>

<p>
Braxa still lay bathed in a rich tranquillity: the
only other occupants of the sun-warmed causeway
being a couple of nondescript gentlemen, who had
been leaning over the low rail, watching the approach
of the boat and spitting thoughtfully into the sea.
These two eyed the new arrivals with a certain
languid curiosity, but beyond that they betrayed no
apparent interest in their proceedings.
</p>

<p>
"It's amazing to me," said Tony, looking round,
"that any one could have had the bad taste to start
a revolution here.  It's like brawling in a mortuary."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you mustn't judge Livadia by this place,"
protested Jimmy.  "There are enough scoundrels in
Portriga to make up for any shortage elsewhere."  He
took out a small rusty key from his pocket.
"Come along," he added.  "If we hang about
admiring the view we shall probably have Saltero's
policemen after us."
</p>

<p>
He led the way down the jetty towards a roughly
built wooden shed which stood a few yards back on
the beach, and unfastening the padlock, threw open
the door.  Inside, amongst a medley of fishing nets
and other nautical obstructions, stood a large
travel-stained motor car with steel studded tyres.  It was
evidently in good order, for it started with the first
pull up of the handle, and having seated himself at
the steering-wheel, Jimmy brought it deftly out on
to the hard beaten sandy track which ran up into the
main road.
</p>

<p>
"One penny all the way," he observed encouragingly.
"Any more for Chancery Lane or the
Bank of England?"
</p>

<p>
Tony closed and locked the door of the shed.  "I
shall sit behind with you, Molly," he announced.
"Then we can hold hands under the rug."
</p>

<p>
They settled themselves comfortably in the
tonneau, and starting on his second speed Jimmy shot
off up the beach with surprising and rather
disconcerting velocity.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the track, where it joined the road,
several of Braxa's more energetic citizens were
sheltering from the rays of the sun.  As the car
approached they all moved forward in a desultory
fashion to scan its occupants; and one of them, a
stout gentleman in uniform, with a sword trailing
by his side, stepped out officiously into the roadway
and held up his hand.
</p>

<p>
If he was under the impression that his action
would cause the car to pull up, he must have been
bitterly disappointed.  Without faltering, or even
slackening speed, its driver swerved round him at a
distance of about two inches, and left him shouting
and gesticulating wildly in the centre of a cloud of
dun coloured dust.
</p>

<p>
A few yards further on, the road turned away inland,
and as soon as they had negotiated the corner,
Jimmy glanced back over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"We've torn it now," he observed complacently.
"That was one of the policemen."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "I thought it must be," he said.
"He looked so well fed."
</p>

<p>
"Is there anything he can do?" inquired Molly;
"except to try and arrest the <i>Betty</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"He might send a message to Portriga asking for
instructions," answered Jimmy.  "It all depends on
whether he's got a suspicious nature."
</p>

<p>
He turned back to concentrate his attention on the
steering, for they were passing through the main
street of Braxa, and one or two small carts, with
sleepy-looking pairs of oxen attached to them, were
straggling amiably about the roadway.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry now that we didn't run over him,"
said Molly regretfully.
</p>

<p>
"We might go back and do it," replied Tony;
"but I think on the whole we had better trust to
Providence.  If Providence is really with us one
policeman can't make very much difference."
</p>

<p>
This argument seemed to convince Molly, for she
attempted no further conversation until they were
clear of the village, and travelling rapidly along the
sandy and ill kept road which ran northwards
towards Portriga.
</p>

<p>
Then, with a smile, she turned again towards Tony.
</p>

<p>
"I'm thinking of the ambush at Valona," she
said.  "I hope it's a nice comfortable one, because
they'll have to stop there a long time if they are
going to wait for me."
</p>

<p>
Tony sat up suddenly in his seat.  "By Jove!"
he said, slowly, "we never settled that point, did
we!  What are you going to do about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, if things turn out anything like right,"
returned Molly cheerfully, "I shall simply tell the
escort that they had better find some other way of
getting me into Portriga.  I don't want to be mixed
up in a free fight just before I'm married."  She
laughed gently.  "I should like to hear what Saltero
says about you, Tony," she added.  "He'll shove
everything down to your account, you know."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "I hate to treat him like this," he
observed sadly, "but it really can't be helped.  In a
big crisis the lesser virtues always have to give way
to the greater."
</p>

<p>
"You must explain that to him," said Molly,
"if you ever run up against him again.  It will
probably console him quite a lot."
</p>

<p>
By this time the last traces of Braxa were already
some distance in the rear, and the countryside had
assumed that forlorn and neglected aspect which
forty years of misgovernment have so successfully
impressed upon the greater part of Northern Livadia.
Here and there they came across an occasional
peasant woman, slouching along under a heavy burden:
presumably carrying on the family business while
her lord and master was assisting to make history
in the Capital.  With these exceptions, however, the
road was absolutely deserted, a fact of which Jimmy
took full advantage by pushing the car along at the
utmost limit of speed which the deplorable surface
would permit.
</p>

<p>
The only relief to the monotonous landscape was
the long range of hills towards which they were
steadily making their way.  These rose sharply in
the near distance against the cloudless blue sky, and
somewhere amongst them, as Tony knew, lay the
Château of Saint Anna and the goal of their expedition.
</p>

<p>
At last Jimmy slackened down, and looked round
again from the driving seat.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better get ready for trouble," he said.
"The turning's about half a mile on from here, and
it's a hundred to one they'll have a patrol out at
the corner."
</p>

<p>
Tony acknowledged the information with a
reassuring wave of his hand; while Molly, after
settling herself into a decorous attitude, opened her
prayer-book at random and commenced to study
"The Publick Baptism of Infants" with a deep and
absorbed interest.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy proceeded forward at the same leisurely
pace, until, bit by bit, the branch road that he had
spoken of crept into view, turning off to the right,
and then winding its way up through the hills, like a
piece of yellowish ribbon dropped down carelessly
from the sky.
</p>

<p>
At the point where it joined the main road stood
a straggling coppice of stunted oak trees.  To the
unsuspicious eye there was nothing about it to suggest
the least danger; but quite suddenly, while the
car was still about a hundred yards distant, the
apparently peaceful prospect underwent a startling
change.  With the crash and swirl of breaking
undergrowth, a number of uniformed figures scrambled
out hastily into the sunlight, and running forward
with their rifles in their hands, formed up into
an irregular cordon across the roadway.
</p>

<p>
It was a well planned manoeuvre, for even if the
occupants of the car had wished to escape, it would
have been practically impossible for them to do so.
As it was Jimmy thrust on his brake and slowed down
immediately into a mere crawl.  Then turning round
to Tony he observed with an air of respectful apology:
"I'm afraid we shall have to pull up, Lord Haverstock.
I expect they have got the steam-roller at
work round the corner."
</p>

<p>
Before Tony could reply, a savage-looking gentleman,
who appeared to be an officer, detached himself
from the rest, and barked out some instruction in a
hoarse and unintelligible voice, then followed by
several subordinates, all gripping their rifles ready for
immediate action, he strode rapidly forward towards
the now stationary car.
</p>

<p>
Its three occupants awaited its approach with
commendable dignity.  Jimmy sat stiff and upright,
still holding the steering-wheel, Tony lolled back in
his seat with an air of slightly annoyed boredom,
while Molly, after one incurious glance at the
situation, had resumed her interrupted study of the
Publick Baptism of Infants.
</p>

<p>
A few yards distant, the officer, who at closer
quarters looked like a rather dog's eared edition of
Kaiser Wilhelm the Second, halted his men in the
roadway.  Then advancing by himself to the side of
the car, and dropping the point of his scabbard with
a menacing clink on the ground, he addressed
himself to Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
As he spoke in Livadian, Tony was unable to follow
what he said.  From his manner, however, it was
pretty easy to guess that he was demanding to know
who they were and what business had brought them
into the neighbourhood.  It was also fairly plain
that he had made up his mind not to be trifled with,
and that the first sign of any attempt to escape,
would be the signal for a volley of bullets from the
soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy listened in silence, until the harsh string of
words which were showered at his head had come to
an end.  Then with a significant glance at the soldiers
he leaned towards his questioner, and made some low
reply in the same language.  It evidently had
something to do with the inadvisability of treating the
matter to too public a discussion, for after hesitating
a moment, the officer wheeled round and ordered his
henchmen to withdraw three paces into the
background.  Then, still looking extremely stern and
suspicious, he turned back to Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
Exactly what the latter said was of course as
unintelligible to Tony as the previous questions had
been.  It was evident, however, from the occasional
introduction of such phrases as "Lord Haverstock of
London," and "the Château of Saint Anna," that
he was telling the story they had agreed upon in the
yacht and judging by his manner he was letting off
this romantic fiction with the convincing plausibility
that one would expect from anybody who for several
years had been intimately connected with the motor
trade.
</p>

<p>
Of its effect upon the officer there could be no
doubt.  The threatening hostility on his face gave
way gradually to an expression of surprise, not
untinged with a certain dawning respect, and when he
spoke again it was in an altogether different if still
slightly suspicious tone.
</p>

<p>
For several minutes the dialogue continued its
course, and then, breaking off suddenly, Jimmy
leaned back over the seat, and addressed himself to
Tony.
</p>

<p>
"This gentleman," he said, "is Major Paqueta
of the King's army."
</p>

<p>
Tony inclined his head in the polite if somewhat
haughty fashion of a true English nobleman&mdash;a
salute which Major Paqueta acknowledged by a stiff
military bow.
</p>

<p>
"He would like to have a look at the King's
letter," continued Jimmy.  "I've explained the
position to him, but he has orders not to allow any
one to pass this corner."
</p>

<p>
With a slight air of aristocratic condescension
Tony took out the document in question from his
pocket and handed it to Jimmy, who in turn passed
it on to the Major.
</p>

<p>
The gallant soldier unfolded it and carefully
scrutinized its contents.  One could see from his face
that he was deeply impressed, but even so there were
still distinct traces of doubt and hesitation in his
manner when he looked up and again addressed
himself to Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
A brief discussion followed, and then once more
the latter turned round to explain.
</p>

<p>
"It's like this, Lord Haverstock.  Major Paqueta
believes that the letter is genuine, but his orders are
very strict.  He says that if we want to go on to the
Château we must take him with us."
</p>

<p>
"Why, certainly," replied Tony without an
instant's hesitation.  "Tell Major Paqueta that I
shall be delighted, and that if he wishes to return
here we can give him a lift back.  At least," he
added drily, "I hope we shall be able to."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy passed on this communication&mdash;or at all
events the first part of it&mdash;and for a second time the
Major clicked his heels and genuflected stiffly.
Then after a word or two of apparent explanation, he
collected his three soldiers and proceeded up the
road as far as the corner, followed at a dignified pace
by the car.  Here he handed over his command to a
bloodthirsty-looking sergeant, and having given the
latter some careful instructions, clambered up into
the front seat alongside of Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
Turning down the branch road the now personally
conducted expedition sped along rapidly towards its
goal.  There was little conversation, for Jimmy was
too occupied in avoiding the ruts to return anything
but the briefest answers to their new friend's
occasional remarks, while Molly, despite the jolting of the
car, still remained buried in her baptismal studies.
She looked up once at Tony, who winked at her
gravely, but this familiarity only met with a chilling
clerical reserve that did not encourage further
advances.
</p>

<p>
About every half mile they came across small parties
of soldiers, patrolling the road, all of whom drew
up across their path as they approached.  On each
occasion, however, the sight of Major Paqueta, sitting
up like a ramrod in the front seat, was sufficient to
insure their undisputed passage: that obliging gentleman
being evidently the senior officer in command of
the district.
</p>

<p>
As the road gradually began its ascent into the
hills, these patrols increased in numbers, and Tony
realized that Congosta's statement about the difficulty
of rushing the place by force was by no means
an exaggerated one.  A very small body of
well-armed and determined men could indeed have held
the track against an army corps, for the great rocky
boulders that towered up on either hand afforded
admirable cover, and offered a ready means of blocking
up the road if such a course were rendered necessary.
</p>

<p>
At last, after about two miles of this upward
progress, they came out over the crest of a long narrow
gorge, and with startling abruptness the Château of
Saint Anna suddenly swept into view.  It stood on
the summit of the next hill&mdash;a large castle-like
looking building of white stone, with a number of small
attendant cottages straggling down into the valley
below.  It was not more than a mile distant, and
despite Tony's constitutional calmness a momentary
thrill ran through his heart as he gazed across the
short intervening space which was all that now
separated him from Isabel.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><br />
KIDNAPPING THE BRIDE
</h3>

<p>
In a few minutes they were mounting the steep
street which appeared to be the only approach to the
Château.  The route was plentifully sprinkled with
soldiers, and from the cottage doorways on either
side women and children watched the visitors go
past with open-eyed interest.  The sight of Major
Paqueta on the front seat seemed still to be a sufficient
guarantee to everyone for their respectability; and
on they went through an avenue of salutes from the
soldiers, which Tony acknowledged by occasionally
raising his hand with an aristocratic languor that
was extremely impressive.
</p>

<p>
It was not until they reached the main entrance to
the Château&mdash;a big stone archway spanned by a
couple of iron gates&mdash;that any attempt was made to
arrest their progress.  At this point two armed
sentries on guard stepped forward with raised
bayonets, and not wishing to run any unnecessary risk
of puncture, Jimmy at once brought the car to a
standstill.  Almost at the same moment a small door
at the side was opened and an officer in full uniform
strode out into the roadway.
</p>

<p>
He saluted Major Paqueta, and for several
moments the two of them remained engaged in an
animated conversation, the results of which appeared
to be distinctly satisfactory.  At all events, on an
order from the newcomer, the two big iron gates
were pushed slowly open, and with commendable
care Jimmy steered his way in under the archway.
</p>

<p>
They found themselves in a large courtyard,
surrounded on three sides by various portions of the
Château, and decorated in the centre by the
equestrian statue of a stout gentleman, brandishing a
menacing sword in the direction of Heaven.  Circling
gracefully round this atrocity, Jimmy drew up outside
the entrance to the house&mdash;a couple of big
iron-studded doors, from which a flight of stone steps
led down to the gravel.
</p>

<p>
With the dignity becoming to his position, Major
Paqueta descended from the car.  Their arrival had
evidently been observed, for as he did so, one of the
doors was opened from inside, and an elderly-looking
steward or butler, supported by two assistants,
appeared upon the threshold.
</p>

<p>
The Major stopped to make a remark or two in
Livadian to Jimmy; then with another formal and
apparently apologetic bow to Tony, he mounted the
steps and was ushered into the house.
</p>

<p>
"He's gone to see who's at home," explained
Jimmy, leaning his elbow on the back of the seat.
"He says he won't keep us waiting long."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "We have done our bit," he
observed philosophically.  "It's all up to Providence now."
</p>

<p>
Molly, who had closed her prayer-book, and was
sitting beside him with downcast eyes, squeezed his
hand gently under the rug.
</p>

<p>
"Good luck, Tony," she said in a low voice; "just
in case we don't see each other again."
</p>

<p>
Before Tony could make any response the officer
who had admitted them through the gate appeared
suddenly along the courtyard behind them, and took
up his position on the steps within earshot of where
they were sitting.  Tony, of course, did not know if he
understood English, but considering the somewhat
delicate nature of their position it seemed advisable
to avoid any unnecessary risk.  He therefore contented
himself by returning Molly's squeeze, and in
tactful silence the three of them waited for the next
development.
</p>

<p>
It was not long in arriving.  Once more the big
portal swung back, and Major Paqueta, with the
pompous-looking steward in attendance, came
down the steps and addressed a few words to
Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
The latter climbed down from his seat, and without
waiting for the assistance of the steward, opened
the back door of the car.
</p>

<p>
"We are to go in," he announced with superb
coolness.  "The Count of Saint Anna is prepared to
receive us."
</p>

<p>
Throwing back the rug, Tony and Molly followed
him out, the latter still keeping her eyes down, and
holding the prayer-book before her in a conspicuous
position.
</p>

<p>
Preceded by the steward and Major Paqueta they
ascended the steps, and entered a lofty hall lit by a
glass dome and set around with marble pillars.
Behind these were a number of tall mahogany doors
leading into the various apartments.  On either side
of one of them, which was open, stood the two footmen
in rigid immobility, and between this expressionless
pair of statues their guide conducted them into a
large, handsomely furnished room, where an elderly
gentleman in a frock-coat was standing by a
writing-table, waiting to receive them.
</p>

<p>
The Count of Saint Anna, for it was evidently their
host who faced them, bowed courteously at their
entrance.  He was an amiable-looking old boy with
gold spectacles and a long white moustache carefully
waxed at the ends.  From this demeanour at all
events there was no hint of any hostility or suspicion
towards his visitors, and Tony felt a momentary wave
of relief that since her arrival in Livadia Isabel should
have been in such apparently good-natured hands.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the door was closed the Count cleared
his throat and commenced to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," he observed in very painstaking
English: "I have the pleasure to make your
knowledge.  Major Paqueta says that you carry a letter
from His Majesty the King, and that you wish to
speak with me privately on a matter of much
importance."
</p>

<p>
Tony bowed, and stepping forward, again produced
the invaluable scrap of paper which had been
returned to him by the Major.  The old gentleman
accepted it, and having adjusted his spectacles read
it through with extreme care.  The perusal could not
really have occupied him more than a minute, but
to three of those present it seemed to be the most
prolonged and poignant minute ever extracted from
the womb of time.  At last, however, he looked up
again, and with infinite relief they saw that the charm
had worked.
</p>

<p>
"I will speak with these gentlemen in private," he
said, addressing himself to Major Paqueta.  "This
is undoubtedly the writing of His Majesty."
</p>

<p>
It seemed from the Major's face as if he were
slightly disappointed by this abrupt dismissal, but
like a true disciplinarian he accepted the situation
without remonstrance.  Bowing again stiffly, he
wheeled round and marched to the door and the
next moment the four of them were alone.
</p>

<p>
The Count motioned his guests to be seated.
</p>

<p>
"I understand," he said, "that there is one of you
gentlemen who is able to speak our language.  It
would be best perhaps if he should explain.  I have
a small knowledge of English, but it is not good to
listen with."
</p>

<p>
Tony turned to Jimmy.  "Go ahead, James," he
said encouragingly.  "Tell the Count of Saint Anna
exactly what the King has asked us to do."
</p>

<p>
With that easy assurance that had won him his
chequered way through the world, Jimmy set about
his task.  He had one of those happily constituted
natures (so frequent amongst prominent statesmen
and successful men of business) which enables its
possessor to become automatically more convincing
the further he departs from the truth.  Unintelligible
as his actual words were to Tony, there was a
ring of sincerity about them which filled the latter
with intense admiration, and made him feel that
much as he had always appreciated Jimmy, he had
up till that moment failed to do him complete
justice.
</p>

<p>
The Count on his part appeared to be deeply
impressed.  He followed Jimmy's trail of lies with
the closest attention, occasionally interjecting a
question, and nodding his head with grave satisfaction
over the answers that were immediately forthcoming.
It was an entertaining spectacle, and but
for the stake at issue, and an uncomfortable sensation
that every minute added to their danger, Tony would
have felt quite sorry when it came to an end.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the recital Molly remained very
unobtrusively in the background.  She had seated
herself in the darkest corner of the room, and with
her eyes fixed steadily on the carpet, she appeared
to be wholly absorbed in some form of inward meditation.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's pause when Jimmy had
finished, and then, with a final and decisive nod, the
Count rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"My friends," he said in English, "you have
indeed done a great service to His Majesty.  You
have also my own gratitude.  I do not hide from
you that it has been of much distress to me that the
Princess Isabella is not more happy.  If to speak
with this good gentleman will be of comfort to her,
that is indeed all that we should wish.  I will
myself take him to her presence."
</p>

<p>
It was an exhilarating moment, but all three of
them managed to preserve their self-control.  With
extreme gravity Molly got up from her seat and
moved quietly in the direction of the door, Tony and
Jimmy also rising and acknowledging the Count's
speech with a couple of polite bows.
</p>

<p>
"In a minute I shall rejoin you," added the latter.
"In the meanwhile I trust that you will regard this
poor apartment as your own."
</p>

<p>
He crossed the room and opened the door politely
for Molly who, still clasping her prayer-book in front
of her, passed solemnly through into the hall.  The
Count paused for an instant on the threshold to
return the salutations of his guests, and then
following her out, closed the doors behind them.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy pulled out a handkerchief and softly
pressed it to his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Holy Moses!" he whispered.  "If Ananias
hasn't turned in his grave he's the most unjealous
blighter who ever lived."
</p>

<p>
"You were wonderful, James," said Tony, with a
genuine reverence in his voice.  "I think we shall
have to change the idea of running our garage on
honest lines.  It would be a sheer waste of genius."
</p>

<p>
"We needn't worry about that yet," retorted
Jimmy.  "We have got to get out of this hole first.
I don't know what you think, but it seems to me
that our part of the business was child's play
compared with that those two girls have got to
tackle."
</p>

<p>
"They'll do it," replied Tony confidently.  "I've
the most perfect faith in Molly."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy took a deep breath.  "She's great&mdash;magnificent,"
he said.  "There isn't a woman in the
world to touch her.  She'll do her part all right, but
it's the other one I'm thinking about.  How can one
expect a young girl who's no experience of acting to
bring off a job like this?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Tony.  "You don't know Isabel."
</p>

<p>
He walked to the writing-desk, and stood for
an instant looking down at the open blotting-book.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if the Count would mind my using his
paper and envelopes," he added meditatively.  "I
think this would be rather a good opportunity of
answering Da Freitas' letter."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go on," said Jimmy with a chuckle.  "That
will be all right.  He told us to look on the place as
our own."
</p>

<p>
Tony seated himself at the desk, and taking out his
fountain pen pulled a sheet of paper towards him.
He paused to reflect for a few moments, and then
dating the letter with the exact hour, began to write,
slowly and deliberately.
</p>

<p>
He had not covered more than half a page, when
the door opened and the Count of Saint Anna came
back into the room.
</p>

<p>
"I have taken your friend in to the Princess," he
said.  "She was surprised, as you would expect, but
I think it will make her happy to speak with him.  I
return to bring him back in a little while.  You
gentlemen will do me the honour of lunching with
me, as soon as their talk is finished?"
</p>

<p>
Tony, who had got up from his chair, shook his
head.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much, Count," he said, "but
I'm afraid we shall have to start back as quick as we
can.  The fact is I have got an appointment with the
English Ambassador.  He is coming to lunch with
me on my yacht."
</p>

<p>
He brought out this impromptu falsehood with
such perfect readiness that even Jimmy was
momentarily staggered.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said the Count.  "I am sorry.  If you
could have waited it is possible that you would have
had the pleasure to meet the Count de Sé.  We are
expecting him at any time now.  He is, as you know,
to take the Princess to Portriga."
</p>

<p>
"What a pity!" replied Tony regretfully.  "I
should love to have had a chat with him if we could
have managed it."  He paused.  "By the way," he
added, "I hope you don't mind my making free with
your property like this.  I was just writing a line
to my friend the Marquis da Freitas.  I daresay
the Count de Sé would take it with him when he
goes in."
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman spread out his hands in a
reassuring gesture.
</p>

<p>
"Señor," he said, "please to continue.  All that
I have in this poor house is at your disposal."
</p>

<p>
Taking him at his word, Tony resumed his seat
at the desk, while Jimmy, with some opportune
remark in Livadian, promptly withdrew their host to
the further side of the room.
</p>

<p>
Continuing to write with extreme deliberation,
Tony finished his letter, which occupied exactly two
sides of the note-paper.  Then he blotted it, and
sitting back in his chair, read it through carefully
before folding it up.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
  Tuesday,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE CHATEAU OF SAINT ANNA,<br />
  11.53 A.M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere in Livadia.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
MY DEAR MARQUIS:
</p>

<p>
It was very kind of you to write and say good-bye,
as I don't suppose you had much time to spare your last
day in England.
</p>

<p>
I am more than sorry that I haven't been able to look
you up and thank you personally during this flying visit
of ours to your beautiful and exciting country.  You,
I feel certain, will share this regret, but your admirable
philosophy will doubtless enable you to make the best
of it.  Making the best of unfortunate situations is the
real secret of a happy and successful life.
</p>

<p>
May I add that you can always rely on us for the most
perfect discretion with regard to any secrets that we
happen to share in common.  I shall consider it a great
kindness if you will convey to His Majesty my truest
congratulations on his marriage, of which, under the
circumstances, I feel quite sure you will thoroughly
approve.
</p>

<p>
Wishing you the best of success in your patriotic
efforts on behalf of Livadia,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  I am, my dear Marquis,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your sincere admirer,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANTONY CONWAY.<br />
</p>

<p>
P.S. You were quite right about the proverb.  Ha!  Ha!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Having enclosed this in an envelope and addressed
it, Tony got up from his chair and handed it to the
Count.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be much obliged if you will give that to De
Sé," he said.  "I want the Marquis to get it as soon
as possible and I expect your postal arrangements are
a bit disorganized."
</p>

<p>
The Count shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"All is confusion for the moment," he admitted,
"but I trust that by Monday we may hope for better
things.  So soon as the King is married there will be
no more fighting."
</p>

<p>
He put the letter away carefully in his inside
pocket, and for a few minutes continued to discourse
on the revolution and its possible developments.  It
was quite evident that he shared Colonel Saltero's
opinion as to the immediate effect of the coming
ceremony, and that he looked forward to the future
with a complete and touching confidence.
</p>

<p>
At last, again adjusting his spectacles, which had
a habit of slipping down his nose, he glanced up at
the clock on the mantelpiece.
</p>

<p>
"I think," he said "that I might now return to
the Princess.  It was, I understand, for twenty minutes
that your good friend wished to speak with her."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it would be as well," said Tony reluctantly.
"I hate to rush away like this, but we really
ought to get back as soon as possible.  I don't want
to keep the Ambassador waiting."
</p>

<p>
They moved together towards the door, and as
Tony opened it he added: "I should like to take the
chance of having a look at your hall pillars if I
may.  I never saw finer marble in my life."
</p>

<p>
A gratified smile lit up the Count's features.
"It is considered a not unfavourable example of
our architecture," he said.  "I am honoured that it
should meet with your approval."
</p>

<p>
He conducted them outside, and after again
apologizing for leaving them, mounted the broad
staircase and disappeared from view along the gallery
above.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Tony and Jimmy remained standing
where they were, apparently lost in admiration.
One glance round, however, had shown both of them
all that they really wished to see.  Through the
partly open front door they had caught a glimpse of
Major Paqueta and the other officer engaged in
conversation on the steps, while a faint but clearly
audible ticking below told them that the faithful
car was still in the same position where they had
left it.
</p>

<p>
"We might be able to manage it," whispered
Jimmy; "even if there's a hitch at the last moment."
</p>

<p>
"There'll be no hitch," replied Tony gently.
"Put your trust in Providence, Jimmy, and admire
the hall."
</p>

<p>
He strolled placidly round from pillar to pillar,
examining the carving at the base of each, and
occasionally patting one with his hand, as if to express his
approbation.  Jimmy accompanied him, sauntering
along with equal nonchalance, and puffing at a
cigarette which he had lighted while talking to the
Count.
</p>

<p>
They were just completing the circuit and were
within a few feet of the door, when a sudden sound
above brought them to a halt.  They both looked
up, and as they did so two people appeared at the
head of the staircase.
</p>

<p>
One was the Count, coming down with his hand on
the banisters, and talking away affably in his
indifferent English.
</p>

<p>
The other&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Standing where he was, Tony stared up at the
slim black-coated figure, that with prayer-book in
hand and lowered eyes was descending the staircase
alongside of their host.  The likeness to Molly as
he had last seen her was so amazing that for just one
numbing instant a horrible fear that she had failed
gripped him by the heart.
</p>

<p>
Then&mdash;somehow or other&mdash;he knew&mdash;knew beyond
any shadow of doubt that it was Isabel herself.  All
his coolness returned to him instantly, and drawing
in a deep, delicious breath he stepped forward to
meet them.
</p>

<p>
"His Majesty will be very grateful to you," said the
Count in a low voice.  "I am happy to say that the
kindness and sympathy of this good gentleman have
been of much comfort to the Princess.  She is like a
different person.'
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt she is," replied Tony heartily.
"I know from experience that a talk with Mr. Monk
always makes one feel better and happier."  He
held out his hand.  "Good-bye, Count," he
added, "and thank you again so much for your
kindness."
</p>

<p>
The Count shook hands warmly with all three of
them.
</p>

<p>
"It has been a privilege to make your friendship,"
he replied.  "But I will not say 'good-bye.'  It is
possible, I hope, that you will be returning here
before long."
</p>

<p>
"It is," admitted Tony, "distinctly."
</p>

<p>
"And when you come," continued their host,
shaking his finger playfully, "I shall not permit you
to leave us a second time in so great a hurry."
</p>

<p>
Tony smiled, and again wrung his hand.  "I am
sure of that, Count," he said; "quite sure of it."
</p>

<p>
They walked to the doors, which had been thrown
back by the steward, who had suddenly reappeared
upon the scene, and passed out once more into the
sunshine and freedom of the open air.
</p>

<p>
Isabel did not waste any time.  Without looking
to the right or left, she stepped up quietly into the
tonneau, and getting in after her Tony settled
himself between her and the steps.  With almost equal
promptness Jimmy and the Major took their places
in front.  There was a farewell wave from the Count
and the other officer, a sputtering of gravel as the
wheels commenced to revolve, and the next moment
the car was circling again round the stout gentleman
with the sword, and heading gaily towards the archway.
</p>

<p>
Tony's sensations, as he found himself once more
slipping past the open cottage doors, were so radiantly
exhilarating that it was all he could do to keep
them under control.  Indeed, but for the fact that
his right hand was clasping Isabel's left under the
rug, and that the other was temporarily occupied in
returning the salutes of the soldiers by the roadside,
he felt that the temptation to throw his arms round
Major Paqueta's neck would have been utterly
irresistible.
</p>

<p>
The necessity for silence&mdash;always a difficult
virtue in his case&mdash;did not tend to make the struggle
any easier.  A dozen questions were trembling on
his tongue, but apart from the fact that Jimmy was
driving at a pace which would have rendered
anything but shouting absolutely useless, he knew it
would be stark madness for Isabel to begin talking
until they had succeeded in ridding themselves of
their passenger.  So with splendid if painful
self-control he sat mutely beside her, while steadily
gathering speed, the car swept up the opposite hillside
and plunged joyously out of sight of the Château
into the narrow gorge above.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of slowing down occasionally
as he passed the various patrols, Jimmy pushed along
in such an animated fashion that in what seemed to be
an amazingly short time they had again descended
from the high ground, and were racing back along
the winding valley which led into the main road.
As they came in sight of the thicket where they had
first had the privilege of making Major Paqueta's
acquaintance, two or three of the latter's soldiers,
who were evidently on the watch, came hurrying out
from amongst the trees.  Seeing that it was their
leader returning they formed up promptly into some
kind of order, and putting on his brakes, Jimmy
brought the car to a halt a dozen paces or so from
where they were standing.
</p>

<p>
With a few words, apparently expressive of his
thanks, the Major climbed down into the roadway.
Then, drawing himself up, he bowed twice&mdash;once to
Tony and once to Isabel: a polite attention which
they both returned as gracefully as their somewhat
cramped circumstances would allow.  At the same
moment Jimmy thrust in his clutch, and lurching
forward again, the car swung rapidly round the
corner on to the main Braxa road.
</p>

<p>
A few hundred yards from the wood Tony's self-control
was unable to hold out any longer.  Throwing
back the rug he lifted up Isabel's hand, and
regardless as to whether any one could see him or
not, pressed it recklessly and joyously to his lips.
</p>

<p>
With a little gasp she laid her other hand upon his
sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, say it's true, Tony.  Tell me it's really true!"
</p>

<p>
Her words were almost carried away by the wind,
for sublimely indifferent to the ruts Jimmy had let
the car out to its fullest extent, and they were racing
and bounding along in a fashion which would have
done credit to a high-spirited chamois.
</p>

<p>
With a glad laugh Tony put his arm round her and
drew her close up against him.
</p>

<p>
"It's the truest thing that's ever happened," he
answered.  "You are mine now, Isabel&mdash;mine, mine,
mine; and all the fat-headed Kings in Europe will
never get you away from me again."
</p>

<p>
Satisfied apparently with what she could hear of
his statement, Isabel made no attempt to reply.
With her eyes half-closed she leaned against his
shoulder, swaying with the movement of the car
and holding tight to his hand like a tired but
contented child.
</p>

<p>
"Were you going to marry him?" demanded Tony
abruptly, as a worse bit of road than usual caused a
momentary slackening in the pace.
</p>

<p>
She opened her eyes and nodded.  "Uncle Philip
told me that they had got hold of you too, and that
if I didn't do it they would punish you horribly,
somehow or other.  I meant to kill myself directly
I knew you were safe."
</p>

<p>
The arm with which Tony was holding her tightened
a little in its grip.
</p>

<p>
"If ever I meet Uncle Phil again," he remarked
slowly, "he'll run up against something considerably
harder than Richmond Park."
</p>

<p>
A fresh plunge forward on the part of the car
rendered any further conversation temporarily
impossible, and for the next quarter of an hour they
spun along in the same buoyant fashion, while the
red roofs of Braxa, which were now visible in the
distance, grew plainer and plainer every minute.
</p>

<p>
Some way short of the straggling outskirts Jimmy
again checked his speed, and pulling into the side of
the road came to a sudden and unexpected halt.
</p>

<p>
"How d'you do, Isabel," he observed, looking
round over his shoulder.  "Glad to meet you."  Then
addressing himself to her companion, he added:
"What's your notion about things, Tony?  I think
myself we'd better make a dash for it.  Run slap
through the town and straight down on to the landing
stage.  I suppose the boat will be there all right."
</p>

<p>
Tony nodded.  "One can always depend upon
Guy," he said.  "But how about the car?  What
are you going to do with that?"
</p>

<p>
"Scrap it," replied Jimmy.  "Leave it on the
quay.  It doesn't belong to me you know, it belongs
to the garage.  I've got all my earthly possessions
in my pocket."
</p>

<p>
"Right away then," said Tony, "and don't stop
for anything."  He turned to Isabel.  "You won't
be frightened if we have to run over a few policemen,"
he said.  "It's just possible they may be on
the lookout for us."
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head.  "I don't mind," she said
firmly.  "Not in the least."
</p>

<p>
"Well, look out for squalls," remarked Jimmy
cheerfully.  "It's neck or nothing now."
</p>

<p>
He pulled his Homburg hat on tighter and started
off again down the road, which stretched out ahead
of them bare and dusty in the blazing midday
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Peaceful as Braxa had seemed when they had
passed through it earlier in the morning, it was at this
hour even more deserted than before.  The heat of
the sun seemed to have driven such people as were
about into the shelter of the wine shops, and except
for a few unhappy-looking dogs, rummaging amongst
the garbage, a deep, languorous tranquillity brooded
over everything.
</p>

<p>
They raced up the main street at a pace which
sent the dust flying in clouds on either side of them;
and without sounding their horn or otherwise
announcing their approach, they swept round the
corner into the big open space where they had had
their previous encounter with the policeman.  They
were half-way across, and were heading straight for
the track that led down on to the beach, when the
drowsy silence of the square was suddenly disturbed
by a hoarse shout on the left.  Tony glanced round
in the direction of the sound, and was rewarded by
the sight of two uniformed figures hurrying out from
the shadow of the trees, and running and stumbling
towards them with loud and peremptory cries.
</p>

<p>
"You're too late," he observed placidly.  "Go on,
Jimmy."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the car shot up the slight incline which
hitherto shut out the beach from view and at the
same moment a half stifled exclamation broke
simultaneously from all three of its occupants.  Right
across the track, in such a position as to shut out any
possibility of passing it, stood a big clumsy ox-cart,
half full of sand.  Some yards further on they could
see the driver chatting affably to a couple of fishermen,
but even if he had wished to help them, he was
too far away to be of any use.
</p>

<p>
Under the circumstances Jimmy did the only thing
that could possibly have saved them.  Thrusting
out his clutch, he flung the wheel hard over to the
right, and with a wild swirl the car left the track, and
plunging forward into the soft sand at the side, came
to a staggeringly abrupt standstill.
</p>

<p>
Despite the shock, Tony had opened the door and
was out on the beach almost before the wheels had
ceased to revolve.
</p>

<p>
"Come along," he said coolly; "plenty of time."
</p>

<p>
But for one fact, it is probable that his statement
would have proved true.  This fact unfortunately
just made all the difference.  The sudden stoppage
had flung Jimmy forward with such force against
the steering-wheel that all the breath had been
knocked clean out of his body, and for the moment
he was as completely helpless as any human being
could possibly be.
</p>

<p>
Seeing what had happened, Tony darted round to
the other side of the car, and catching him in his
arms, lifted him bodily out of the seat.  Even while
he was doing so, the first paralysing effects of the
blow began to wear off; but the delay&mdash;brief as it
had been&mdash;was quite long enough to bring about
disaster.
</p>

<p>
Already the pursuing policemen had come racing
up over the rise behind, and were bawling out frantic
instructions to the driver of the cart and the two
fishermen who were with him.  Thunderstruck as
the latter seemed to be, they yet retained sufficient
intelligence to grasp the fact that they were being
called upon to assist the law.  For a second only
they hesitated; then with a simultaneous movement,
they lumbered forward up the beach, and
true to the voice of duty, rushed in upon their
quarry.
</p>

<p>
The next minute was probably the busiest in
Tony's life.  Letting go of Jimmy, he sprang
forward to meet the first of their assailants&mdash;a big
black-bearded fellow, who had slightly out-distanced
the others.  The man dived for his body, but swinging
up his left with a terrific jolt Tony caught him
full in the face, and sent him sprawling over on the
sand.  Then, just in the nick of time, he turned to
meet the driver of the cart.  There was no chance of
repeating his former tactics, for the sheer weight of
the latter's rush had brought him into close quarters,
and the next instant they were swaying up and down,
clutched in each other's arms.
</p>

<p>
At any ordinary time they would have been a very
well matched pair, but the desperation of the
moment had filled Tony with a kind of wild madness
that seemed almost to have doubled his strength.
Wrenching his right arm free he drove his fist deep
into his opponent's midriff with the force of a piston-rod.
The man's legs shut up under him like a
clasp-knife&mdash;down he went in a gurgling heap, dragging
Tony with him in his fall.
</p>

<p>
The latter was up again almost immediately, but
his first glance round showed him the hopelessness of
the situation.  Racing down the slope with all
possible speed, the two policemen had already reached
the scene of action.  One of them was rushing
towards him with a drawn sword, and yelling to him to
surrender, while the other was dodging round the
car in pursuit of Isabel.
</p>

<p>
At that moment, just when everything seemed to
be lost, a violent "bang" from behind burst
suddenly on Tony's ear.  He spun round instinctively&mdash;and
there, fifteen yards away, was the Heaven-sent
figure of "Tiger" Bugg, leaping up the beach with the
speed and fury of an avenging angel.  A few paces
in the rear stood Guy Oliver, hatless, perspiring, and
with a smoking revolver levelled in his hand.
</p>

<p>
Even as Tony turned there came a second spurt
of flame.  He felt the bullet whistle past him, and
almost simultaneously an agonized yelp of pain
showed that it had found its mark.  He swung round
again instantly, just in time to see the onrushing
policeman drop his sword, and stagger back a couple
of paces with his left hand clasped to his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Disregarding everything else Tony flung himself
to the rescue of Isabel.  At the sound of the second
shot, the man who was chasing her had pulled up
abruptly in his tracks, apparently debating whether,
under the new circumstances, discretion was not the
better part of valour.  Before he could make up his
mind Tony was on him.  He flung up his arms to
defend himself, but a smashing left in the throat
toppled him over like a pole-axed bullock, the back of
his head coming in violent contact with the radiator,
and thus completing his discomfiture.
</p>

<p>
Panting, and quite unable to speak, Isabel leaned
against the side of the car.
</p>

<p>
"It's all over," said Tony cheerfully, and
slipping his arm gently round her, he bent down
and kissed her.  "I'll carry you to the boat," he
added.
</p>

<p>
She made some inaudible protest, but without
paying any attention he picked her up in his arms
and turned towards the quay.
</p>

<p>
It was a stricken field that met his gaze, but all
danger was apparently over.  With Bugg's assistance
Jimmy was just struggling to his feet, while his late
assailant, stretched out full length on the sand beside
him, seemed to have given up any further interest
in the proceedings.  On the right, still clutching his
revolver, Guy stood on guard over the remainder of
the enemies, none of them, however, appeared to be
in any condition to interfere.
</p>

<p>
He glanced up with a white and eager face as Tony
strode forward, carrying Isabel in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Is she all right?" he gasped breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
Tony gave him a reassuring nod.  "We are both
in the best of health, thank you, Guy," he said.
"How about the boat?"
</p>

<p>
Guy took a deep breath.  "You'll find the boat
there," he said, pointing towards the jetty.  "Get
on board as quick as you can.  Bugg and I will bring
Dale along."
</p>

<p>
Without further remark, Tony hurried on down the
beach, and passed in between the two wooden posts
which marked the entrance to the rough stone
causeway.  A few yards ahead of him stood the Captain
of the <i>Betty</i> holding the gig's painter in his hand.  In
the boat below a couple of sailors were ready at their
oars.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, skipper!" exclaimed Tony.  "How nice
of you to have come yourself!  I hope we haven't
kept you waiting."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he gently lowered Isabel to her feet,
and supporting her with one hand, held out the other
to Captain Simmons.
</p>

<p>
The sailor gripped it in his huge brown paw.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God, you're safe, Sir Antony," he exclaimed
heartily.  "I'd have given anything to be
able to lend a hand, but I didn't dare leave the boat.
We'd have been done if they'd cut us off."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we didn't want any more help," said Tony
laughing.  "The whole beach is littered with corpses
as it is."  He paused.  "Let me introduce you to
Miss Francis," he ended, "the lady I'm going to
marry."
</p>

<p>
For a moment the skipper stared at Isabel in dumb
amazement: then with that readiness in emergency
which always distinguishes the British sailor, he
took off his cap and made her an abrupt bow.
</p>

<p>
"Pleased to meet you, Miss," he remarked huskily.
</p>

<p>
At that instant through the entrance to the jetty
appeared the dishevelled figure of Jimmy limping
cheerfully along between Guy and Bugg.
</p>

<p>
"Here come the others," said Tony.  "We'd
better get aboard before there's any more trouble."  He
dropped down into the boat, and steadied himself
in the stern.  "You pass Miss Francis down to me,
will you, skipper?"
</p>

<p>
Like a man in a dream, but with the most respectful
and solicitous care Captain Simmons lifted up
Isabel and lowered her gently into Tony's arms.  As
her feet touched the planks Bugg, Guy, and Jimmy
appeared on the causeway above, and the next
moment they too were scrambling hastily down into
their places.  Captain Simmons followed with the
painter.
</p>

<p>
"Let her go," he exclaimed curtly.
</p>

<p>
The two sailors swung back together, and with a
steady gliding motion the boat drew away from the
strenuous shores of Livadia into the blue waters of
the sunlit bay.

CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><br />
MAKING SURE OF ISABEL
</h3>

<p>
For the second time that morning Lady Jocelyn
opened the <i>Daily Mail</i> and adjusting her glasses bent
over the centre column with its staring and heavily
leaded headlines.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
  AMAZING DEVELOPMENT IN LIVADIA<br />
<br />
  KING PEDRO MARRIED TO THE PRINCESS<br />
  ISABELLA<br />
<br />
  THE CIVIL WAR ENDED<br />
</p>

<p>
In Saturday's issue we were able to give our readers
the exclusive information that King Pedro and the
ex-prime minister of Livadia, the Marquis da Freitas, had
landed in Portriga.
</p>

<p>
Our well informed special correspondent, who transmitted
the news, hinted also that within a short time we
might expect to hear of some dramatic developments in
the situation.  The correctness of his forecast has been
amply demonstrated in a further and lengthy message
received late last night; a message which conveys the
striking information that King Pedro and his rival claimant
to the throne, the beautiful daughter of the late Don
Francisco, were married on Sunday morning in the
Cathedral at Portriga.
</p>

<p>
The situation from the political point of view is dealt
with fully in our leading article.  We feel certain,
however, that all readers of the <i>Daily Mail</i> will join in
congratulating the Royal and happy pair upon their
romantic union.
</p>

<p>
During his residence amongst us King Pedro has given
many proofs of the manly and democratic spirit by which
he is animated, and we share our correspondent's hope
that under his rule and that of his fair and youthful
consort, our old established allies&mdash;the Livadian people&mdash;will
enter upon a long era of peace and prosperity.
</p>

<p>
From our Special Correspondent.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
PORTRIGA, Sunday night.
</p>

<p>
Today has been the most dramatic day in the whole
history of Livadia.  Within an hour of my sending off
my last message (since when I have been unable to
communicate) a number of posters and bills began to make
their appearance all over the town, announcing that on
Sunday morning King Pedro would be married to the
Princess Isabella, the beautiful and rather mysterious
daughter of the late Pretender, of whose whereabouts
very few even of her own supporters seemed to have any
definite knowledge.
</p>

<p>
With great difficulty, and only through the kind
assistance of Mr. Watson the British Consul, I managed
to obtain an interview with General Almaida.  The latter,
who appeared to be in a state of considerable agitation,
declared the report to be a deliberate canard set about
by the King's supporters.
</p>

<p>
Further inquiries, however, led me to the conclusion
that the Princess was actually in the hands of the
Royalists, and that having been won over by the King's
courtesy and charm of manner, she had agreed to the marriage
as the natural and happy solution of their rival claims.
The truth of this view was soon demonstrated.
</p>

<p>
At an early hour on Sunday morning, all the foreign
correspondents in Portriga received an official invitation
to the Cathedral, the approaches to which were held in
considerable force by the King's troops.  The ceremony,
which was originally announced for twelve o'clock, did
not take place until nearly one-thirty, owing I believe
to a final attempt on the part of General Almaida to
break through into the centre of the town.  His belated
effort was easily frustrated, as a large number of his
followers had already laid down their arms, recognizing
the hopelessness of their position.
</p>

<p>
The marriage rites, which were performed by the aged
Bishop of Portriga, were carried through with considerable
state.  Except for a momentary interruption half
through the service, the authors of which were promptly
arrested and conveyed from the Cathedral, the ceremony
proceeded along its course without any untoward
incident.  On leaving the building the Royal Pair were
greeted with the utmost enthusiasm by a large and
apparently well contented crowd and drove in state to
the ancient palace of St. Peter, where from time
immemorial the ruling house of Livadia have been
accustomed to reside.
</p>

<p>
The new Queen of Livadia is a young girl of remarkable
beauty&mdash;not unlike an Englishwoman in appearance.
She has a wealth of that wonderful auburn hair, which is
frequently to be met with in the Southern provinces of
Livadia, and throughout the ceremony she conducted
herself with a grace and dignity that won the admiration
of all beholders.
</p>

<p>
It is not difficult to believe that under its young and
happily endowed rulers, who will be guided by that
experienced statesman the Marquis da Freitas, the country
will soon recover from the troublous times through
which it has been recently passing.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Having read so far, Lady Jocelyn laid down the
paper, and leaned back against the sofa.  For a
minute or so she remained there motionless, gazing
straight out in front of her with an expression such as
few people had ever seen upon her naturally shrewd
and cheerful face.
</p>

<p>
At last, with a faint sigh, she picked up the paper
again, and stared once more at the blatant headlines.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my poor Tony," she said softly to herself.
"My poor dear boy!"
</p>

<p>
The words had hardly left her lips when the noise
of a motor pulling up outside came in plainly through
the open window.  A moment later the front door
bell pealed loudly.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn got up, and walking slowly to the
door intercepted the maid who was in the act of
crossing the landing.
</p>

<p>
"I am not at home, Ellen," she said, "unless it's
Mr. Henry Conway.  I am expecting him, so you can
bring him straight upstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, M'lady," murmured the girl sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
All Lady Jocelyn's servants adored her, and
although to them Isabel's abrupt disappearance was
still a complete mystery, they were very troubled and
upset at the obvious effect which it had produced
upon their mistress.
</p>

<p>
Walking back across the room Lady Jocelyn had
just reached her former seat, when a sudden sound
of voices in the hall below made her pause abruptly.
An exclamation escaped from her lips, and with an
unconscious movement she stretched out her arm
and caught hold of the back of the sofa to steady
herself.  The next moment footsteps came scrambling
up the stairs, and forgetful of all her professional
training, Ellen burst wildly into the room, her
round face shining with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, M'lady!  It's Miss Isabel and Sir Antony,
M'lady&mdash;and&mdash;and Mr. Oliver."
</p>

<p>
Even as she spoke the first-named couple appeared
in the doorway, and with a little glad cry, Lady
Jocelyn stepped forward, holding out her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Tony!  Isabel!" she whispered; then as they
hurried towards her, and each threw their arms round
her, she added, half laughing, half crying: "Oh,
you dear, bad children!  How you've frightened me!"
</p>

<p>
In the middle of their embrace, Guy Oliver followed
them into the room.  With the exception of a slight
trace of sunburn he looked as sedate and respectable
as ever; indeed the thought of him standing on a
blood-stained beach blazing away with a revolver
seemed like the wildest fancy of an imaginative
dipsomaniac.
</p>

<p>
"We only landed at Southampton early this
morning," explained Tony penitently; "and I
couldn't spoil things by telegraphing."
</p>

<p>
At this point Ellen, who had been standing
contemplating the scene with the frankest curiosity,
suddenly woke up to a realization of her professional
lapse.  With a reluctant sigh she withdrew noiselessly
from the room, closing the door behind her, and
dashed off downstairs to communicate the exciting
tidings to her fellow-servants.
</p>

<p>
With their arms round Lady Jocelyn, Tony and
Isabel conducted her gently to the sofa, and seated
themselves one on each side of her.  Guy took his
place in an armchair facing them.
</p>

<p>
"You must forgive me, Guy," said Lady Jocelyn.
"I am so happy and excited I haven't even said how
do you do, and I'm sure it's all through you that I
have got my mad children back alive and well."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is," exclaimed Tony.  "If Guy
hadn't waded in and slaughtered half the Livadian
police force on the beach, we shouldn't have had a
dog's chance of getting clear.  Isn't that so, Isabel?"
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded.  "He was very brave," she said
gratefully.  "I shall never forget how fierce and
splendid he looked."
</p>

<p>
Poor Guy's face turned a vivid crimson.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I had seen him," remarked Lady Jocelyn,
with considerable regret in her voice; "but it seems
to me we are beginning at the wrong end."  She
stooped forward and picked up the <i>Daily Mail</i>,
which had fallen to the floor.  "Look at that," she
added, pointing to the headlines, "and for pity's sake
tell me what it all means."
</p>

<p>
"I've seen it," said Tony.  "It means that even
Lord Northcliffe may be deceived at times."  He
paused.  "I didn't tell you quite everything before
we started, Aunt Fanny.  I had some silly idea it
might worry you."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Lady Jocelyn generously.
"If you will make up for it now, I think I might
manage to forgive you."
</p>

<p>
She took Isabel's slim hand in hers and leaned
back against the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"I'll try," said Tony gravely; "but Guy and
Isabel will have to help.  It's the sort of story that
requires at least three strong people, if one wants
to tell it properly."
</p>

<p>
The incompleteness of his previous confidences had
of course lain in the fact that hitherto he had omitted
all mention of the leading rôle played by Molly
during the latter stages of the proceedings.  Going
back now to the point at which she had first told
him of her secret marriage to Pedro, he described
in full detail how the main idea of a possible rescue
had originated with her, and the daring and skilful
manner in which she had thrown herself into the
scheme.
</p>

<p>
He gave a rapid account of their run down through
the night to Southampton, and of how&mdash;thanks to
McEwen&mdash;they had managed to reach Portriga in a
time for which the nominal horse-power of the <i>Betty's</i>
engines failed to convey any adequate explanation.
</p>

<p>
Then, after describing the respective arrivals on
board of Jimmy and Colonel Saltero, he went on to
explain how they had all come to a unanimous
decision that in a raid on the Château of Saint Anna
lay their only possible chance of success.  With an
account of that immortal drive and of their experiences
in the Château he at length brought the story
down to the moment when Molly and the Count had
retired upstairs to administer spiritual consolation to
the Princess Isabella.
</p>

<p>
At this point he paused.
</p>

<p>
"I think that's about my share," he observed
unselfishly.  "You go on now, Isabel; tell Aunt
Fanny the rest of it."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn, who had been listening to him with
an expression of entranced interest, sat upright in her
seat, still holding Isabel's hand.
</p>

<p>
"What an amazing and delightful person this
Molly Monk must be!" she exclaimed.  "And to
think that she is the granddaughter of old Monk
at the Lodge!  I always said there was something
extraordinarily bracing in the Helbeck air."
</p>

<p>
"I think she must be the bravest and cleverest
girl that ever lived," said Isabel with shining eyes.
"You know I hadn't the faintest suspicion that she
wasn't a real clergyman until the Count had gone
out of the room.  You can't imagine what I felt
like when she suddenly bolted the door and began to
talk to me.  I was so astonished at first that I don't
believe I could have done anything by myself, but
she was as cool and quiet about it all as if it was just
the most ordinary thing in the world.  All the time
she was talking she was making me change clothes
with her, and by the time we had got into each other's
things I didn't feel frightened or stupid any longer.
</p>

<p>
"Then, while she was doing up my hair and
putting on my wig, she began to ask me questions&mdash;whether
I spoke to the Count in English (which I
always had done)&mdash;how I behaved as a rule when he
came into the room&mdash;and, and other things of that
sort.  I tried to answer as well as I could, and you
can't think how quick and clever she was at
understanding.  She made me walk about and sit down
and talk to her, and by the time she had finished
dressing herself and had done her hair like mine, she
was able to imitate me so exactly that I could hardly
believe it was real.
</p>

<p>
"We were expecting the Count back every minute
then; so she unbolted the door and told me as quickly
as possible what I was to do when he came.  She
said that whatever happened I was not to answer him
if he spoke to me, but only to nod or shake my head,
and leave everything else to her.
</p>

<p>
"Then we heard him on the stairs, and she sat
down quite quietly in the chair I generally used, and
made me stand just beside her with my back to the
door."
</p>

<p>
Isabel paused, as if the memory of that rather
tense experience still lingered poignantly in her mind.
</p>

<p>
"I'd have given a thousand pounds to be there,"
observed Tony regretfully.  "It must have been the
best moment of the whole show."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't go through it again for anything in
the world," declared Isabel with a reminiscent shiver.
"It was like standing on the edge of some horrible
precipice waiting to be pushed over."  She paused
again.  "I can't tell you exactly what happened,"
she went on.  "I suppose I was too excited to take it
in properly.  I know that he spoke to me first, and
that Molly interrupted him and said something about
feeling a great deal happier and not minding so
much now that she was going to be married.  I
remember that she held her handkerchief up to her
eyes as if she had been crying, and that the Count
seemed very pleased and satisfied and patted her on
the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Then almost before I knew what was happening
we were walking down the stairs together.  I heard
him talking, but I don't know the least what he said,
because when we got to the head of the banisters I
suddenly caught sight of Tony and Mr. Dale standing
in the hall, and somehow that put everything else
out of my head.  It was all I could do to stop giving
a shout and rushing down to them."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you didn't show any sign of it," said Tony.
"I never saw a more dignified descent in my life."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure I should have dropped dead from sheer
excitement," remarked Lady Jocelyn sympathetically.
"It's marvellous what sound nerves you've
got, Isabel; considering the shocking way your father
used to drink."
</p>

<p>
"It all happened so quickly," said Isabel, "I
simply didn't have time to do anything silly.  I
just got straight into the car, and in another minute
we were rushing away down the hill, and nothing in
the whole world seemed to matter then."
</p>

<p>
"And how about the drive back and the battle on
the beach?" inquired Lady Jocelyn.  "Come along,
Tony, I insist upon knowing everything."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the first part was very simple," said Tony.
"We dropped dear old Paqueta at the point where
we picked him up, and I think he was quite sorry to
say good-bye to us.  Then we jogged along
comfortably till we came to Portriga.  Of course we were
on the lookout for trouble there, because of the row
we had had with the policeman in the morning.
Nothing happened, however, until we were just
reaching the beach, and then two savage looking
gentlemen jumped out at us in the most unfriendly
way.  We should have been quite all right, only as
luck would have it there was a big cart drawn right
across the track that ran down to the jetty.  We
couldn't pass it, so we had to pull up and get out.
After that&mdash;" he broke off with a smile, "well, you
had better ask Guy to tell you the rest," he finished.
"He's so saturated with blood and slaughter that
he will be able to do justice to it."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, Guy," said Lady Jocelyn.  "Don't
mind my feelings."
</p>

<p>
"He is talking the most absolute nonsense,"
exclaimed Guy indignantly.  "Bugg and I were
waiting on the quay&mdash;we had come ashore with the
Captain to fetch him&mdash;and of course when we saw
them being attacked we naturally came to their help.
Tony had already knocked down about three people,
so there was practically nothing left for us to do.  I
am afraid I did shoot one of the policemen with a
revolver that I happened to have with me, but I am
thankful to say that he was only wounded in the
shoulder."
</p>

<p>
"He's ashamed of himself," said Tony mercilessly;
"that's what's the matter.  Why he came up the
beach like a roaring tiger, and if it hadn't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door, and almost
simultaneously Ellen presented herself on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, M'lady, Mr. Henry Conway has
called."
</p>

<p>
"Henry!" repeated Tony; "what a joke.  It just
needed Henry to make the party perfect."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jocelyn looked round her with an exclamation
of dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear!" she exclaimed.  "I quite forgot to tell
you I was expecting him.  He rang up early this
morning and left a message that he was coming
round.  I think he wants to know where you are, Tony."
</p>

<p>
"I am not quite sure myself yet," said Tony;
"but I shall be delighted to give him all the
information I have."  He got up from the sofa.  "Besides,"
he added, "it will be a good opportunity to introduce
him to Isabel."
</p>

<p>
"Are you serious?" demanded Guy.  "Do you
really mean you want to see him?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I do," replied Tony.  "I think people
ought to meet their new relations as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Lady Jocelyn.  "Show him up,
Ellen."  Then she turned to Tony.  "Are you
going to tell him everything?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," said Tony.  "We must keep
Isabel's past an absolute secret between ourselves.
I have given my word to Da Freitas about that."
</p>

<p>
"But you know what Henry is," objected Guy.
"He is sure to ask all sorts of questions right away."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if he does," said Tony, "we must give him
an evasive answer&mdash;like the sailor."
</p>

<p>
Before Guy had recovered from this reply, footsteps
were heard ascending the stairs, and the next
moment Henry was ushered into the room.
</p>

<p>
As he caught sight of its occupants he paused
dramatically on the threshold; his naturally stolid
face expanding into an expression of the utmost
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"You here!" he exclaimed, addressing himself to
Tony.  "Why I have been hunting London for you
the last twenty-four hours."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you had good sport," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you wouldn't disappear like that and not
leave any address behind," proceeded Henry in an
aggrieved voice, "I had some very important
business I wished to see you about."
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry," replied Tony; "but as a matter of
fact I had some very important business too."  He
took Isabel's hand, and assisted her up from the sofa.
"I have been getting engaged to be married."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Henry stared at him in dumb amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Is&mdash;is this a fact?" he stammered.
</p>

<p>
"I should think it was," replied Tony cheerfully.
"Let me introduce you to Isabel.  This is Cousin
Henry, Isabel.  I'm sure you'll get along together
splendidly."
</p>

<p>
By a tremendous effort Henry managed to pull
himself together.
</p>

<p>
"You must forgive me," he said with a quite
creditable bow to Isabel.  "Tony took me so
completely by surprise I scarcely knew what I was
saying."  He turned to Lady Jocelyn and Guy.
"Why have I heard nothing about this?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"We only heard about it ourselves ten minutes
ago," replied Lady Jocelyn soothingly.  "Tony
always does things in that sort of way, you know."
</p>

<p>
Henry's eyes travelled back to Isabel, and rested
on her with admiration&mdash;not, however, untinged by a
certain trace of doubt.
</p>

<p>
"You must forgive me," he said again, "but at
present I haven't even the pleasure of knowing your
name."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel," repeated Tony, "Isabel Francis.  It's
a nice name, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
To this inquiry Henry returned no answer.
</p>

<p>
"Are you any relation of Sir George Francis of
Laurence Weston?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head.  "I don't think so," she
replied simply.
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact," said Tony, "Isabel has no
relations at all.  That's one of her chief charms."
</p>

<p>
"No relations at all!" exclaimed Henry in an
aghast and incredulous voice.
</p>

<p>
"Not one," said Tony firmly.  "But you needn't
worry about that, Henry.  Our engagement has the
warm approval of both Aunt Fanny and Guy."
</p>

<p>
"That's quite right," said Lady Jocelyn, nodding
her head.  "I think Tony is a great deal luckier than
he deserves."
</p>

<p>
Henry turned to Guy.  "And you too?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Guy rose manfully to the occasion.
</p>

<p>
"If I was in Tony's place," he declared, "I should
be the proudest and happiest man in the world."
</p>

<p>
With the air of one who has been unexpectedly
torpedoed Henry abandoned the unequal contest.
</p>

<p>
"In that case," he observed in a slightly dazed
tone, "I can only offer you both my sincere
congratulations."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would be pleased," said Tony.
"You always wanted me to get married, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope," continued Henry, addressing himself
to Isabel, "that before long we may have the pleasure
of becoming better acquainted.  Unfortunately I
can't stay now, because I have an important political
appointment at half-past twelve."
</p>

<p>
"What a pity," remarked Lady Jocelyn.  "I was
just going to suggest that you should stay and lunch
with us."
</p>

<p>
"It's very kind of you," said Henry; "but I'm
afraid my presence at the House is indispensable."  He
turned back to Tony.  "You must bring Miss
Francis round to see us as soon as possible," he
added, "this afternoon if you can.  I know that
Laura will be intensely anxious to meet her."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure of that," said Tony.  "We are a bit
full up, but we'll come along if we can.  Anyhow,
you will be able to let Laura know what a charming
girl Isabel is."
</p>

<p>
He smiled cheerfully at his cousin, and the latter,
whose faculties still seemed to be suffering a little
from the shock that they had received, shook hands
all round and withdrew from the room.
</p>

<p>
"I think he took it splendidly," said Tony, as soon
as the door was closed.  "There's lots of grit in the
Conway family when it comes to the point."
</p>

<p>
"Are you really going round there this afternoon?"
inquired Guy.
</p>

<p>
Tony shook his head.  "I am afraid we sha'n't
have time," he said.  "I have to go and get a special
license and I believe it's a most exhausting business."
</p>

<p>
"A special license!" exclaimed Lady Jocelyn.
"Do you mean you are going to be married
at once?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course we are," said Tony.  "I am not going
to run any more risk of losing Isabel.  Once we are
married she will be quite safe whatever happens.
They can't have her back then without making me
King of Livadia, and I think that even Congosta
would draw the line at that."
</p>

<p>
"It's the best plan, Aunt Fanny," put in Guy
quietly.  "We talked it all over on the boat coming
back.  This man Congosta is still in London, and if
he was to come across Tony and Isabel it might lead
to all sorts of trouble.  The safest thing is for them
to get married and go away at once on the <i>Betty</i>.
Congosta will probably return to Livadia before long,
but meanwhile it's absolutely essential that they
should both keep out of the way."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it is," admitted Lady Jocelyn.  "From
what you have told me I should imagine he would be
a very unpleasant person to have hanging about while
one was trying to enjoy a honeymoon."  She got up
from the sofa.  "You haven't half finished the story
yet," she added.  "I want to know all sorts of
things&mdash;how you propose to account for Molly's sudden
disappearance from the Gaiety, and what's happened
to that nice friend of yours who provided you with
the car.  He seems to be a remarkably amiable and
obliging young man, but I am afraid he must have
rather damaged his prospects of making a
comfortable living in Livadia."
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy's all right," said Tony.  "He came back
with us, and we are going to start a shop together
in Piccadilly.  As for Molly&mdash;well, I don't think we
shall have any real trouble there.  She has no relations
who are likely to make a fuss, and we have fixed
up a good sound lie for the theatre that ought to
keep them quiet."
</p>

<p>
"You shall tell me about it when I come back,"
said Lady Jocelyn.  "I must go downstairs first
and talk to the cook, or else we sha'n't have enough
to eat for lunch.  You are all going to stay of course."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I can't," replied Guy, shaking his
head.  "I must get back to Hampstead as soon as
possible.  There are a lot of things to see to before
Tony goes away."
</p>

<p>
"If you are thinking of giving us a wedding
present," said Tony, "we should like the revolver with
which you murdered the policeman."
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Guy," said Lady Jocelyn, taking
his arm.  "They are an ungrateful pair of children,
and we will leave them to their fate."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I wish I was really rich," said Tony, as the door
closed.  "I should like to buy Long Acre and put a
high wall round it, and never let any one go into it
except ourselves."  He took Isabel's hands and drew
her gently towards him.  "I can't think of anything
else," he added, "that isn't absolutely and splendidly
perfect."
</p>

<p>
"Only about Molly," answered Isabel, looking up
at him with rather troubled eyes.  "Oh, Tony, you
do think she's safe and happy, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure of it," said Tony confidently.  "They
can never go back on what they have done, and in
about two months Molly will have the whole place
under her thumb.  If any one's going to be unhappy
it will be Da Freitas and the Count de Sé."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do hope so," said Isabel feelingly.  Then
she paused, and took a long breath.  "She will make
a wonderful queen, Tony.  She will be as good at it
as I should have been bad."
</p>

<p>
"You were meant for something much nicer than
that," said Tony.
</p>

<p>
He drew her down into his arms, and bending
forward pressed a long and passionate kiss upon her
soft and slightly parted lips.
</p>

<p>
"I love kissing you, Isabel," he remarked.  "You
always taste of crushed violets."
</p>

<p>
"Do I?" said Isabel dreamily.  "I'm so glad, Tony."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," said Tony; and with some deliberation
he kissed her again.
</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
